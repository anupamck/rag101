    "body": "There is comfort in following a recipe. There is learning in not following one.\n\nToday, I plunged impromptu into making a version of pulikuttu upperi, a traditional tamilian dish made with raw banana, brinjal (eggplant) and okra. I eyeballed a recipe online and naturally, our Berlin house lacked several key ingredients. Further, I decided to use the recipe as a guideline and improvised as I went along.\n\nThe result was an overly sour blend, with the eggplant having cooked too much, and the banana too little. Not following the recipe left me with less than perfect results. But here's what I gained from the experience:\n\n An idea of how sour the water is to be while starting a tamarind based dish\n\n The knowledge that eggplant cooks faster than raw banana, and that the latter should be cut into long slender pieces\n\n That excessive sourness can be mitigated with salt and sweet\n\nIn effect, not following the recipe helps us learn about the process, at the expense of sure shot results. It orients us towards the input rather than the output.\n\nOnce we master the inputs, the outputs can be whatever we want, rather than what is prescribed by a recipe."

He assumed that Indians were bats - navigating streets using echolocation, with frequent honks. Hence, Indians could drive even with their eyes closed. Bam! Indian traffic could use a hilarious metaphor or two!\n\nI could have never thought about this, or imagine anybody in India thinking about our traffic this way. It pays to look at these things with a fresh pair of eyes.\n\nBen is also different in other ways. Today, he is a freelancer, and he excels at teaching people to use code for creating digital art. He has taught three semesters at a university in Berlin. His credentials?  Free tutorials on Youtube. Ben never finished his formal education.\n\nCollege degrees are already relics of a past, that the world clings to out of sheer habit. So are résumés.

    "body": "One must be guarded against hindsight bias - to see something as being predictable or obvious after it has occurred, resulting in distorting our memory. Daniel Kanheman cites an experiment that demonstrates this. Political commentators in Jerusalem, were asked to predict certain outcomes of a meeting between Richard Nixon and Mao Zedong. Their initial observations were recorded before the meeting took place, where the participants assigned probabilities to these outcomes. After the meeting, the participants were asked to recollect their initial probability estimations. The participants unwittingly changed their memories and cited increased probabilities for events that did occur, and reduced probabilities for ones that did not.\n\nBut could this logic be turned on its head to be used as a strength? Viktor Frankl hints at this when he quotes, \"Live as if you were living already for the second time and as if you had acted the first time as wrongly as you are about to act now\". In essence, Frankl recommends using the benefit of hindsight to rectify our present actions. But how does one do that?\n\nDeadlines have the ability to do this. When we take a deadline seriously, it reorients our present, which are moments in the past from its vantage point.\n\nA deadline is an unassuming time warp, if we choose to empower it. A deadline that is not regarded is a snake defanged."

Given all the challenges we shoulder, we surround ourselves with friends who are mostly pleasant to us. Regardless of their best intentions, this niceness could come at the cost of authenticity. The way we are wired makes it easier for us to keep these friends and sideline the ones that tell us unpleasant truths. Marcel Proust went so far as to pronounce that the nature of friendship was to not dispel harsh truth, but to indulge in insincere, pleasant exchanges.\n\nIt takes someone to care enough about you to dole out pointed criticism. A statement, an action, a gesture, an expression - all of these can feel so different going out than when taken in. I am thankful for having a few friends courageous enough to point this difference out.\n\nSuggestion: Thank that friend this reminded you of."

It seems paradoxical that the hardest things to sustain are the ones we are most convinced is good for us.\n\nTerry Laughlin was a swim coach with an eye for detail. He observed that competitive swimming emphasised strength building over technique. There was not enough attention paid to harmony and symmetry - finding the streamlined path of least resistance. This feeling of slipping effortlessly through the water feels delightful in comparison to the red-faced struggle that is pure strength training. The key is to enjoy every stroke. If a particular stroke does not feel good, the input needs to be adjusted until it does.\n\nThis is the key to persistence - to frequently check-in on ourselves while doing it and observing if we are enjoying in that moment. If we are not, there is a disconnect between intent and execution.\n\nWhen I think of building a habit, I try it for one day. If I pay enough attention to it, I'll know if I enjoy it enough to return the next day."

I live in my simulation and you live in yours. A conservative person has her own simulation. So does an ardent Hindutva follower. Scientists, climate change deniers and so on, each a unique simulation. Isn't that the reason we all experience the same reality, interpret it differently and are constantly at each others' throats?\n\nThis fact becomes easier to digest if we question the nature of our reality. The physical world is simulated by our sense organs to manifest as sight, sound and smell, which we believe with unshakeable conviction. Hence, a blind person believes in a different world from the rest of us. An eagle believes in a different world from the rabbit that it seeks out in the canyon below. We are hard-wired to do so - our survival has depended upon it for eons.\n\nWhat is more? These simulations are further distorted by our conditioning - a set of beliefs that are unique to our circumstances. As a result, our reaction to various situations are automatic, even if our reasoning is not. We express these reasons using language, which is a 10,000 year tool for expressing sensations that are 4 billion years old. The result is a hastily drawn sketch of a photograph taken in low lighting, with poor focus and using an old lens. The only thing that unites us is the strength of our conviction.\n\nRichard Feynman talked about how the first principle was not to fool yourself, knowing that you are the easiest person to fool. In Feynman's spirit, I strive to trust my own simulation lesser. The corollary - to learn to acknowledge the simulations of other people more."

Moving houses is the only time we truly realize how much we own. Every bag, every suitcase, every piece of furniture that we carry deepens this understanding.\n\nIt is easy to get attached to stuff that we own, as we go through life. This phenomenon is termed as the endowment effect - where owners attach disproportionate value to the things they possess. We latch on to everything we own unconsciously. This is the reason we end up hoarding things well past their usefulness and feel guilty when we try to throw them away. This is the also reason we end up overvaluing them. In a sense, the stuff we own ends up owning us.\n\nThe means to break away from this attachment is gratitude. By being thankful to the things that have served us, we acknowledge their role in bettering our lives, and this gives us the requisite closure to dispose them without any guilt.\n\nI hope we develop more gratitude by the time we move houses again."

Regardless, I invariably end up falling short.\n\nWhy is it so hard to wake up? Is it harder when it is cold? Is it harder when I have not slept early enough? Is it harder when I have had pizza for dinner? I have been struggling to draw a correlation between these factors, and sure, they do matter. But let us consider the glaring exceptions.\n\nI find myself waking up unfailingly whenever I have an early flight to catch. I set multiple alarms, but I'm up with the first one. Back when I used to cycle regularly, I used to wake up at 4:30 AM to go on a long ride, even if I went to sleep at 1 AM. What made those cases different?\n\nThe reason we do not wake up is because we do not have a compelling enough reason to. This is the strongest correlation I can draw. If the warmth between the sheets is stronger than our plan for the morning, we end up staying in bed.\n\nOf course, it helps to have a plan for the morning."

The presence of one often compromises the other.\n\nIn the past, I have often broken commitments to habits and routines, because on some days, the product would simply not live up to my expectations. My pursuits - writing, guitar, running, chess and so on would all ebb and flow sporadically. This is because in our world, consistency is respected, but perfection is worshipped.\n\nIn recent times, I have decided to give consistency a fair shot. Consistency can be hard and requires a relentless mindset. I have revisited my approach to prioritise consistency, often varying other factors to make it easier to do something regularly - chief among them being perfection.\n\nPerfection is random. We could model perfection as a function that oscillates wildly around a mean value. On some days, we perform exceedingly well, and on others, we simply don't. This is simply how we work. But what about consistency ? Consistency steadily increases the value of the mean as a whole.\n\nThe result of consistency and perfection working together is what we call genius."

We are hard-wired to enjoy them. How, then, do we have more of them?\n\nInteresting people are good conversationalists. To be interesting, (cliche alert!) is to be interested. But cliches are cliches because they are usually true. Let us dig a little deeper: how do we become more interested? To be genuinely interested is harder than it seems. The easiest way to be interested is to find common ground with the person we are speaking with. What if that is not the case? What if we find little or no overlap? These are times when interest is displaced by ignorance.\n\nBut is there a means to reconcile ignorance and interest? In recent times, when I have had too little in common with the other person, I ask them questions about their interests - often really basic ones. These questions have served as bridges to better conversations. As a thumb rule, the more basic the question, the more interesting the exchange can turn out to be.\n\nIn summary, ignorance can be transformed into interest - the key to having engaging conversations. Curiosity catalyses this transformation."

While I often harp on about its curses, today I shall look at one of its biggest blessings.\n\nThe worlds, with its 7.6 billion people offers so much opportunity for meaningful connection. Traditionally, people could only reach out by using broadcasting - transmitting information relevant to a critical mass of people who are concentrated closely enough for it to make economic sense. And the economic challenges of broadcasting have always been formidable. Moreover, this information needs to be reduced to a common denominator of what its audience, considered as a massive homogeneous group, is interested in.\n\nBut humans no longer live in homogeneous masses. There has been no time in history when people have been more different from their next door neighbours.\n\nThe internet has broken this stand-off in several ways - my favourite being podcasts. Today it costs incrementally nothing to listen to an Icelandic voice in the US, vis-a-vis  New Zealand. We now live in the era of narrow-casting, whereby the internet has enabled some of the most unusual, but talented voices to have an audience. One of my favourite podcasters, Dan Carlin, describes it best. He calls himself a street-artist who just happens to work at a really busy street corner - something that the internet, and the internet alone could have gifted him.\n\nThere has never been a better time to seek out busy street corners."

I would feel like I could sustain that pace and rhythm forever. Until I turned to go back.\n\nThe ride back would be much harder. Somehow, the same muscles that had powered me half-an-hour ago, are crying in pain. My lungs are panting for breath and my legs are protesting every push on the pedals. I would realize very quickly that I was riding against the wind. I would also realize that all of the extra spunk in my ride earlier was just the wind lending me a helping hand.\n\nIt is common to attribute favourable circumstances to our own capabilities, while singling out unfavourable ones as external factors. This phenomenon is so prominent that psychologists have termed this the headwind-tailwind asymmetry. Football fans are always convinced that their teams are in the most competitive pools, and that the referees decisions are biased against them (ask Arsene Wenger). Siblings in most households think that their parents were harder on them than the other ones.\n\nThe resulting bias can even lead us to adopt morally questionable positions. Being born into privilege is akin to having a steady tailwind assisting us. As privileged people, we are likely to disproportionately attribute our success to our abilities. This could also lead us to question the challenges faced by people who have led difficult lives. Only the people who weather these adversities themselves can begin to understand them.\n\n(Credit to Tara Brach for triggering this post)"

If you open a window and make love to the world, so to speak, your story will get pneumonia.\" And the person he refers to is the writer herself.\n\nDerek Sivers, an entrepreneur turned writer, altruist and one of my favourite humans on the planet, has a contrarian view - he writes only for other people. His idea? So that his work can be of value to others.\n\nHow do I reconcile this contradiction?\n\nBoth Vonnegut and Sivers have a point. Vonnegut referred to creative writing - an art form that ought to be an end in itself. Most forms of written fiction would fall under this category. Sivers, on the other hand, writes to inform - to share his story and wisdom, so that others can find it useful. Most non-fiction writing also intends to inform.\n\nWhich of these approaches do I adopt for this blog? - Both of them. The topics I intend to write about are broader ones - to provoke thought that could be useful to other people. The style of writing, is one I adopt for its own sake.\n\nThe beauty of wisdom is that unlike science, even contradictory ideas can work in perfect complement."

It was a struggle all along.\n\nBut completing it was oddly satisfying, and more so because we went through all of that. It appears as though difficulty puts our achievements in better perspective.\n\nWe have been conditioned to believe that difficulty is to be despised and avoided. But this is not always so. Kelly McGonigal has studied extensively on how our attitude towards stress can result in it having a positive impact on us. Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi talks about flow - a state of bliss, that results from confronting a challenge that is a little beyond the grasp of our capabilities. Nassim Taleb writes about anti-fragile people, who grow stronger with adversity.

To hold back from hitting the publish button, until these standards have been achieved. To relegate a deadline to the quality of output. To consider one's self only as good as one's last piece of work.\n\nI have approached many of my projects with a perfecting mindset. Except, I've abandoned most of them once I had started. Especially ones where I was not accountable. Especially when the going got harder. As a result, I now bear the burden of several unfinished, unpublished projects.\n\nAn alternative, is the publishing mindset.\n\nThe approach here is to define a process for relentless execution. To avoid changing the process once execution has started. To consider the deadline as sacrosanct. To publish regardless of how complete the project is. To measure quality based on the average of several outputs, rather than the most recent.\n\nI have used the publishing mindset on several of my recent projects. This has been a challenge sometimes. I find it to be inflexible. I fret over how much the quality fluctuates. And on many occasions, I am anxious before I publish.\n\nBut what it has offered in return is liberation. Once I have published, there is no looking back, and no more baggage to bear. It sets me free to pursue my next project."

    "body": "Every human being is on a quest to be the best version of themselves. Some of us are fortunate to have discovered the profession or calling that will get them there, while many of us are still clueless in this regard.\n\nThis dilemma rests at the base of what turns into a crisis as we approach the middle of our lives. As younger people, we can change direction rapidly, deciding to pursue one career one month and decided to try something completely new the next month. As we age, it becomes harder and harder to change the status-quo. We start off as nimble sailboats that can turn in whichever direction the wind blows. With age, we become large ships and changing course involves abandoning a huge amount of momentum.\n\nAnd yet, even with time, the questions around what we are doing with our lives do not die down. If anything, they only get louder. It is this conflict, between louder questions and heavier ships that is the cause for much suffering.\n\nWhat would help us resolve this situation? How do we decide what to pursue, and how can we be sure that after having invested time and effort, our new endeavour would be fulfilling?\n\nOne means to do this is by harnessing the power of habit. The idea is to set aside some time (daily or weekly) to test our new pursuit with relentless regularity. The joy we derive from it should fuel its continuity. The activity we pursue could be open ended - from how to cook better, to what to pursue after getting my PhD. The idea is to dedicate some time to explore this and see if it sticks. The only requirement is for it to give us enough enjoyment to come back and keep at it consistently.\n\nOn doing this for a few weeks, we are able to see if our pursuit is self-sustaining. If it is a business, this could be increasing cash-flows or sales. If it is cooking, the measure could be how we have gotten better at cooking a few dishes, or how many more tasty dishes we have in our repertoire. Once a habit is established, patterns emerge with time. These patterns are more revealing than passing whims and fancies.\n\nThe advantages:\n\n Discernment: We learn to differentiate between pursuits that are a passing fad and ones that we really care about, based on how well we can keep at them\n\n Building skill: We steadily build skill in the chosen pursuit, along the way\n\n Lowering risk: By dedicating a small amount of time regularly, we do not risk drastic actions like throwing away a good job\n\n Steering power: Once we have invested sufficiently in pursuing something, it can be easier to change the status-quo\n\nA regular habit helps us to make decisions about our future by using the present moment to test them out. The consequences of doing so are beneficial either way - finding something more fulfilling than our current pursuit or to rediscovering the real value of what we currently do."

On reaching the ground floor, we set it on the trolley and rolled it alongside the road. Moving it on the trolley was so much easier than having to lift it off the ground. On nearing home, we barely noticed that the noise the trolley made, and when we did, it sounded much better.\n\nIt was as a different trolley that we rolled back home.

    "body": "Thinking of the perfect comeback long past the right moment is an established drawback of the human condition. The term L'Spirit de l'escalier, a French phrase used by English speakers for this phenomenon, translates to staircase wit- because of how the perfect response to a taunt at the dining table only crosses one's mind as he reaches the staircase to his apartment. The German term here also bears the same translation - Treppenwitz.\n\nWhy does this happen? Why is it that the thoughtful response, brimming with wit, only occurs to us well past its useful life? This is because of two modes of thinking that are  fundamental to how our brains function - the focused and diffused mode. The focused mode is what we employ when we consciously and logically try to do a well-known activity. This mode of thinking is used when we are thinking hard of coming up with rejoinders at the dining table. The focused mode is alert and purposeful but rigid in its ways and sorely lacking in creativity. When our head hurts as we force ourselves to come up with creative ideas, the focused mode is in the driver's seat.\n\nThis is where the diffused mode comes in. The diffused mode is random and fires neurons in spread out regions in the brain. But the diffused mode fosters creative thinking and ideation. It gives us brilliant insights when we are dreamily staring outside a bus window, or quite prominently, while showering. Using this mode of thinking, our brain solves problems in the background, connecting several dots as we perform routine activities.\n\nAnother real-life example I can think of is during tests. There are numerous instances where the correct answer to a question or the correct approach to a problem has occurred to me after I have handed in my paper. This is regardless of however long I bashed away at the problem, trying to solve it with a focused head. This happens because I did not give the diffused mode a chance to shine until I handed my paper in and relaxed at little.\n\nJust like focusing on something, we must have language for diffusing on something. By training and harnessing our diffused mode is how we can have our creative side effectively partner our overly logical side, and come up with clever comebacks before it is too late!\n\nCredits: I learnt about the focused and diffused mode of thinking in this excellent meta-learning course."

    "body": "The process of learning is comprised of 4 stages:\n\n1. Exposure: To attend a lecture or read a book. To becomes aware of a concept and to recognize and understand whenever it is mentioned. To know the mathematical formula, the definition of a concept, or the gist of the theory. To look through a solved example and understand the steps involved.\n\n2. Synthesis: To recall and write down on a blank page, what one knows about the subject. To express it in a form that is intelligible. To logically structure the information. To strengthen understanding by transforming intuition into knowledge.\n\n3. Application: To use the learned concept. To relate it to one's own observations. To think of a few examples where one has encountered it in real life. To use the formula to solve the problems in the textbook, as well as the ones outside it.\n\n4. Simplification: To know well enough to explain to others. To bring one's audience to the first stage (Exposure), through one's lessons. To break-down a concept or an idea so well, that mere attention is enough for others to consume it. To teach.\n\nOur true competence in an area keeps increasing as we move down this spectrum. More importantly, the illusions of competence are the highest at stage 1, and continuously diminish with each stage - reading a book may lead us to believe that we understand its contents well enough, but this illusion is destroyed when we try and teach it to others."

Does every banker need to live through a financial crisis to understand market risks? It would be remarkably inconvenient to commit every mistake to learn something comprehensively. What about the mistakes that other people make? Would it not be more efficient to learn from them? What enables or limits us from doing so?\n\nOur empathy makes this learning available to us. By paying enough attention, we put ourselves in other people's shoes and feel what they felt. While watching a video of a sports star getting injured, or while listening to somebody talk about their own failures, the measure of how empathetic we are determines how much learning we can imbibe.\n\nCultivating enough empathy to learn from other people's experience as if it were our own is a powerful ability and a lifelong endeavour.\n\nCredits: Josh Waitzkin's conversation with Tim Ferriss for inspiring this post"

    "body": "Utility is a term used by economists to describe whatever we find favourable and desirable. Utility can be translated loosely to goodness, for simplicity.\n\nThe scarcity mindset subscribes universally to the law of diminishing returns. This means that once we utilize a particular amount of goodness, there is lesser of it to go around. People with this mindset assume that most innovative ideas and discoveries are already behind us. They are quickly bored because they have already seen what there is to see, and nothing piques their interest. They are stingy, because once they part with some of their goodness there is lesser of it for themselves.\n\nThe abundance mindset believes in the opposite - that goodness is self-perpetuating. The disciples of this school believe that since we've witnessed so many exciting innovations, there is a lot more to come. They are not easily bored because are always falling into a moment expecting wonder. They are generous, because they believe that generosity is rewarding.\n\nWhat makes these mindsets interesting is that they are both self-fulfilling prophesies - you get exactly what you wish for.\n\nThe people who believe in the scarcity mindset will not bother putting in the effort required to innovate, and they receive feedback that confirms their beliefs and reinforces them. The same is true of people with the abundance mindset - they are the only ones who are crazy enough to innovate, and eventually succeed. They expect wonder at every moment, are fooled a few times, but are left wonder-struck at other times.\n\nThe abundance mindset promises accomplishment at the risk of delusion. The scarcity mindset guarantees failure at the risk of despair."

    "body": "The conventional way to sell a product has been to make it well, advertise it and distribute it. Even in the absence of an excellent product, good advertising and distribution enough to sell a carbonated drink across the world for more than a century. In these businesses, the word 'sales' is an explicit and integral part of job titles.\n\nBut solutions work differently. Selling solutions through advertising cannot have the desired effect. Besides, the same solution would not serve the needs of different clients. How then do you build a market for solutions?\n\nThe answer is not to sell, but to listen. To meet a customer, look them in the eye and make a connection. The aim here is not to decode the meaning of their words, but to unearth where they are coming from. To relate to their problems and empathize. Professions that sell solutions - consulting and investment banking for example, are also the ones where the job titles of the people who sell (Partner, Director etc.) are completely free from the term 'sales'.\n\nThese are also professions where selling happens at the top of the organization and not the bottom. It takes at least 10 years of training to learn to listen properly."

    "body": "Altruism is the selfless concern for the well-being of others. By definition altruism must be free of self-interest. Zoologists go so far as to define it as the behaviour of an animal that benefits another at its own expense.\n\nHaving established that, let us look at the phrase 'the pursuit of happiness' - a phrase that is enshrined in the American constitution, and resonates with us so naturally. Every person on this world, consciously or unconsciously, makes every decision because they believe that it would result in a happier future. The brilliant Daniel Gilbert, a psychologist who studies happiness, states that the word 'living' and the pursuit of happiness are synonymous.\n\nGilbert also talks about how altruism is very effective in making us happier - something that each one of us can attest to, and is supported by research. Humans are likely to be selfish if left to their devices, but are happier if they are forced to be altruistic. Altruism trumps even individual freedom - the exalted religion of our humanistic times.\n\nHence, if altruism makes people happier, which is every person's reason for living, the paradox here is that altruism can never be free from self-interest.\n\nThis leads me to two interesting conclusions - a practical action and a thought exercise.\n\nThe practical action is to find out ways to force ourselves to be more altruistic. One way this could be achieved is by setting aside a budget for giving every month (could be time or money), and think of ways to actively meet it month after month. It is my hunch that doing this actively rather than passively would be more fruitful.\n\nThe thought exercise is to think of a nation built on an ideal that priorities altruism over personal freedom, and consider ways in which this nation would function differently from today's democracies. I'll be grateful for any ideas here.\n\nCredits: To Daniel Gilbert and his book, Stumbling on Happiness. Check out his interesting interview here."

    "body": "One of the biggest mysteries we are yet to solve is around how we homo-sapiens became the dominant species on earth, and not our more physically and mentally capable relatives (such as neanderthals). Yuval Harari claims that our stories are what make us different. Stories helped homo-sapiens rally around in enormous numbers and overpower every other species on the planet. Tribal battles fought during the ice-age, the crusades and our present idea of national identity are all united by having fictitious stories behind them. Stories come in different shades:\n\nThe good: Several ideas that can help us co-exist on the planet can be crafted into stories, given our affinity to them. Ancient Indian epics and Aesop's fables alike rely on the ease with which we grasp lessons in story form. B.R Ambedkar's statement speech in the Indian parliament on completing the Indian constitution and Martin Luther King having a dream were both fantastic stories. Stories could be a powerful tool in education. They can be used to breakdown and understand the abstract concepts that govern the working of our universe.\n\nThe bad: The reason stories are so effective is that they can get under our skin and hijack rationality or objectivity. Stories can get in the way of us perceiving the truth and insidiously replace it with our truth. Stories can cause us to rile up and behave in ways that are unacceptable to others, and to our own selves. Stories imprison us, and prevent us from witnessing our own actions. A story convinced Gavrilo Princip to kill an Austrian prince and unwittingly cause two world-wars.  Nathuram Godse's story caused him to pull a trigger and assassinate Gandhi.\n\nThe ugly: People are, by nature, conscientious. Our conscience prescribes limits to our actions and prevents us from stepping outside these limits. For Gandhi, this limit was uttering a lie. For Richard Luttrell, it was killing an enemy soldier and finding a picture with his daughter in his wallet, and for Ashoka, it was the slaughter at Kalinga. However, stories can give rise to institutions, that are completely free  of conscientiousness, and this has resulted in unprecedented violence and crime. The vehicle of these institutions is propaganda - a storytelling machinery. The Nazi regime, The Cambodian Khmer Rouge, and Islamic terror are all such institutions .\n\nIn conclusion, much like electricity, stories are good servants and bad masters. Today, we realize that facts do not matter - stories do. We are our stories and our freedom is the extent to which we recognize this.\n\nSources: Sapiens by Yuval Noah Harari is an extraordinary read. Here is an interview with Harari on the James Altucher Show podcast"

    "body": "Being self-centered is not considered a virtue. The world selfish is full of negative connotations and receives its share of brick bats. While altruism is lauded, selfishness is loathed.\n\nBut that does not stop us from being full of ourselves. If being self-centered is really as terrible and unhelpful as it is made out to be, why is it still so widespread?\n\nBecause selfishness has an important role. Being self-centered has kept us alive and is hardwired through evolution. If we did not care enough about ourselves, anyone who realizes the vastness of the solar system alone is likely to stop bother living. If our lens is large enough to encompass cosmic scales, it renders our own selves that much more trivial. As a consequence, there would no good reason to get out of bed and start living.\n\nSelfishness has kept us alive through periods where our lives were difficult and our survival was not guaranteed. It is a self-propagating quality: only genes that preserve selfishness have survived through the eons. The ones that do not have long been fossilized.\n\nWhat we see in our times is merely a correction. Being selfish is no longer as relevant in a stable world, where survival and well-being are guaranteed. All of this criticism that it receives is because we have more of it than is optimal. It is important to realize that this is a comparative and not an absolute treatment.\n\nSelfishness has played and continues to play a crucial role in our lives. It is thanks to selfishness that we are alive today to appreciate virtues such altruism."

    "body": "Daniel Kanheman says that the most effective way to engineer behavioural change is to make the intended behaviour easier to execute. This is achieved most effectively by modifying our environment rather than relying will-power or moral conviction.\n\nWhat this means is to keep the chips and chocolates out of reach, and fruits handy. To sleep in running clothes. To keep the phone on airplane mode before doing anything focused. And to actively under-estimate our will-power.\n\nThe reason this is true is because our minds are lazy, and it takes a lot of effort to exercise will-power. Will-power exerts a cognitive load that our minds actively resist, more so when we are already tired.\n\nBut driving behavioural change can happen in another way.\n\nRight now, the smartest brains in Silicon Valley are studying Kanheman's work to use blinking notification lights to grab attention. To hit us sporadically with dopamine so that we keep coming back for more. To short-circuit our decision making process, so that there is more ad-revenue for their employers.\n\nTwo can play at this game.

It is an investment of our time into an activity that takes value away from us. Therefore, we receive a compensation. Our life is meaningful in spite of it.\n\nMost professions lie somewhere along this continuum between being our work and our job.

    "body": "What constitutes knowledge and intuition? How are they different?\n\nKrishna returned home after a long ride through the countryside on his bicycle - a new road bike. As he enjoyed a hot lunch after a 40 km ride, he thought about his purchase. The gears shifted smoothly. The bike responded well to each push on the pedals during a tough climb. The brakes were powerful and easy to operate. Overall, he had enjoyed his ride and could not have been happier with his decision.  \n\nThis account constitutes Krishna's knowledge of his bike. Having had an experience, it represents what he consciously registers and remembers. If somebody asked him about his ride, this information is what he would use to describe it. However, let us take a look at the first 300 meters of his 40 km ride in real time:\n\nKrishna mounts his new bike - the seat is higher, thinner and harder than that of his old bike. He bends more to sit on it, considering it is a road bike. He pedals on the cement surface of his apartment's basement that feels smooth under the bike's razor thin wheels. The basement echoes with the sound of the cycle's chain ratcheting as he free-wheels through it. He snakes his way around the  pillars to get used to the handlebar. He leaves the apartment complex and the smooth concrete gives way to coarser tarmac. He now cycles faster and gauges how much thrust is generated with every downward push. Finally, he reaches the highway, and sees an oncoming car. He pulls on the brake-levers and the cycle skids to a halt in response to their effortless application. \n\nThis rich set of interactions with his bike inform Krishna's intuition. They are all part of how he feels about the ride, without his explicit knowledge. If he were to purchase a new bike tomorrow, this is the information he would bank upon for making that decision.\n\nWhat we register consciously and remember, constitutes our knowledge. Our intuition comprises the thousands of unconscious perceptions we have during our experiences. Our knowledge is the tip of the iceberg that is visible to us, whereas our intuition is the huge mass of ice that lies under the water. While making involved decisions, our intuition is the agent that is actually responsible, while our knowledge often authorizes this decision regardless of what it is. In the decision making process, our intuition is the Indian parliament, while knowledge is its nominal president.\n\nCompanies everywhere are realizing this today. To get somebody to buy a product, giving them a small taste of how it feels to use it product (a test ride or a trial period) is far more effective than bombarding them with a thousand benefits that it offers."

    "body": "Last night, we went to a concert by Avishai Cohen, my favourite contemporary jazz musician, whose trio was supported by the Babelsberg orchestra.\n\nThe conductor took center-stage and waved his baton to trigger the violins to start a slow tune. The cellos were the first to blend in, followed by the trombones and clarinets. At three corners of the semi-circular group were the largest instruments - a lute, cymbals and a shining tuba.  Every instrument was played by a world-class performer, expressing his or her individual proficiency. And yet, all of them followed the conductor to play as one unit. The conclusion of the piece was punctuated by the crash of cymbals that reverberated through the expansive hall for nearly five seconds. Soon, the members of the jazz trio joined in. The sound system was setup for their individuality to stand out, in perfect harmony with the orchestra. As I witnessed this performance - this elaborate ritual - I thought of how it was a magnificent miracle.\n\nBut with a little more thought, I realized that the public transport system that took us to the concert - the thousands of trains and buses working in perfect synchrony whose real-time schedule was accessible on our smartphones was another miracle. The supermarket where we shopped for making our dinner - foodstuffs from every corner of the world, stored, preserved, transported, displayed and restocked for our convenience was yet another miracle. Electricity,  plumbing, the stock market,  e-commerce - we are surrounded by an endless assortment of miracles.\n\nAnd these are just the ones we have created. I am reminded of a conversation with my dentist on the formation of the human skull. She described how the skull starts its development as four tiny, disconnected bones, growing from different corners and coalescing perfectly to assume its elaborate structure. That this happens for a vast majority of cases without any defects makes our birth a miracle in itself. At that point, I told her about how medical-science must be fascinating field, considering how richly packed with miracles it is. She had replied that this was true of every field, and it is only a matter of whether we choose to observe them.\n\nI realize her wisdom with greater emphasis today."

Amidst all this bustle, I noticed an airport staffer bend below the barricades to get down on all fours with a rag and some cleaning liquid. The crowd of passengers made room for her. She scraped the floor vigorously to clean a tiny, but stubborn speck. Tegel is an old airport, with floors that are quite worn out. And yet, amidst all this activity, it was surprising that somebody bothered enough. A fellow passenger and I exchanged looks and raised our eyebrows. Interesting! Who really cares about that stain?\n\nOn looking again, I realized that she was scraping chewing gum off the floor. Chewing gum is best dealt with at the earliest, considering how it becomes progressively harder to clean. More importantly, one chewing gum stain attracts several others. In effect, that lady was actually cleaning about 10 other such stains two months into the future. Much like pulling a weed out immediately and preventing it from taking over a garden.\n\nOne of the biggest lessons we can learn from the Western world is on keeping our public spaces cleaner. There are people everywhere that stain the floor with gum, but there are also systems that remove these specks before they can encourage this behaviour to grow further.\n\nThis is because they care enough about that stain."

    "body": "The constituents of writing are primarily a message and a writing style.\n\nThe message is the the idea behind the written words. It is the concept that a textbook explains, the plot that a story elaborates, the universal truth that a poem connects with, the event that a newspaper publicises or the discovery that a research paper publishes. At its crux, a message should be simple enough for a five-year old to understand.\n\nBut reading what a five-year old can comprehend is boring. Our mind craves complexity and sophistication. This is where style comes in.\n\nStyle is the choice of words used to convey the meaning. It could be simple and straightforward, or could comprise meaningful metaphors and alluring alliterations. It enables the writer to express herself while entertaining her audience and having fun. We are born puzzle-solvers and writers weave clever patterns into their writing to be more interesting. In some cases, the subject matter is abstract enough for the writer to do away with complexity completely, and adopt a simple style. This is true especially of research papers. At other times, an ornamental style enhances writing, like it does in literature.\n\nHowever, style and message do not get along well all the time. The need to for clarity could conflict with the complexity that style can induce. How does one prioritize?\n\nIn most cases, the message takes precedence over style. A simple and coherent message serves as the foundation for good writing. This would be true for all forms of writing, across literature, poetry and journalism and especially scientific writing. The trunk of the tree ought to be thicker than its branches.\n\nMost budding writers (including me) struggle with this prioritization. It is easier to write long sophisticated sentences than to simplify an idea. This complexity is often present because the message is not clear to the writer's himself. Sophisticated language serves as a veil for incompetence. Our minds and its mechanics are constantly tricking us (and others) into believing that we are smarter than we actually are.\n\nAll great writing has survived through the ages because of the coherent message beneath their intricate sentences. This is why the essence of Shakespeare's plays are simple, yet profound expressions of human nature.\n\nIn summary, it is better to write exactly what you mean, before resorting to fluffy and flowery, but frivolous language."

When something occurs contradictory to these rules is when it doesn't make sense. This rift between our understanding and our observations makes us uncomfortable. This discomfort can change us in several ways.\n\nAmong scientists and philosophers, this change is primarily internal. In the face of this new information, they seek to update their assumptions and beliefs. Through theories, experiments and observations, they change themselves to align with the world as they observe it.\n\nThe entrepreneurs and social reformers among us do the opposite. They confront this difference by making a change that is external. This change could result in a social movement, like feminism or civil rights, or lead to a profitable business. In this manner, they attempt to change the world to align with their beliefs.\n\nAnd what of those who fear this discomfort? They choose to hide and deny what they observe. They decry anything that does not align with their views as fake-news. They hold on dearly to their assumptions and prejudices.\n\nWhenever we observe something that does not add up, it represents a glorious opportunity to make a change - one that is internal or external.\n\nOn the other hand, not changing in the face of contradictory observations has caused great suffering in human history - suffering that is both internal and external."

All programs open quickly and function without any perceptible delay. Every game performs at peak levels. The potency of the device shines through while using it.\n\nWe then install several programs and apps. The device becomes capable of achieving more, but now there is a small delay in loading or executing certain tasks. With time, these lags keep amplifying. The boot up takes more time, and so does the shut down. We finally reach a point where the same potent device we loved frustrates us to no end. The only alternative we are left with is to format our system or to factory-reset the phone.\n\nAs we all know, this drop in performance is due to processes in the background that run continuously. The same processes that give us automated alerts or notifications - a reminder to take the umbrella when it is forecast to rain, an article on AI performing some task better than humans, or news of the latest fit that a celebrity threw somewhere. The scripts that run in the background, accumulating data are looking out for triggers, are the ones that cause the device to slow down.\n\nNow for a quick quiz. Do you feel the itch to check your phone as soon as you wake up? Do you have the urge to your Facebook status, when faced with a long and boring task. Do you turn off airplane mode as soon the plane's wheel hits the ground? Do you check your phone when you stand in a queue for a couple of minutes or are ride the elevator? What triggers those impulses?\n\nCal Newport, the author of Deep Work, encourages us to embrace boredom. Increasingly we are seeing boredom disappear from our lives, thanks to our ability to stay connected every time and everywhere. The routines we follow initiate scripts in our own head, that can hamper our ability to focus and reduce our attention span. The creeping anxiety we feel when we forget to take our phone or are forced to spend some time disconnected is a  sign of these scripts. By embracing boredom, we free up resources that can be used to solve more substantial problems - thinking about the book we are reading and questioning its assumptions, solving that sticky situation we face at work or synthesizing the findings of last month's research. Boredom leads us to pay attention to these more compelling problems and prioritize them over random information that reaches us from the web.\n\nEvery now and then, it would serve us well to hit Ctrl + Alt + Delete and look at the processes in the background that are dictating our behaviour at a certain moment. What we see there can be revealing, and could even have us perform a factory-reset on the information we consume."

    "body": "Two terms that have been overused among technologists and businessmen alike are efficiency and effectiveness. These words are often (and incorrectly) used interchangeably. The objective of this post is to tease out their differences, and their implications to business in today's world.\n\nLet us start with the similarities. Both efficiency and effectiveness pertain to outputs based on a given input. High efficiency and effectiveness alike refer to getting more for less. The difference is that efficiency deals purely with quantitative measures, while effectiveness is qualitative. Efficiency is calculated. It is a science.  Effectiveness is perceived. It remains an art.\n\nWe can choose to play the efficiency game in the market - launching a product whose benefits can be quantified. The speed of an internet connection, the fuel-efficiency of a car, or the rate at which a particular machine can manufacture widgets are all efficiency measures. The advantage here is that your value can be clearly communicated. On the flip side, your competitor can do the same thing. Moreover, this value can, at best, only scale linearly with performance. A car that is twice as fuel efficient can only run two times the distance for the same amount of fuel. This is regardless of how much harder it is to actually develop and manufacture something twice as efficient. Value that is pegged on efficiency can diminish rapidly.\n\nValue can also be based on effectiveness. The job market is a perfect example. Most companies are looking for \"effective\" employees - a vague description that can only be supported by adjectives like creative, open-minded, empathetic and so on. Value is communicated not in numbers, but based on feelings and satisfaction of the user. This property also makes it hard to compete against, because the value of effectiveness is subjective, and highly biased towards familiarity and existing relationships. Additionally, value can scale non-linearly. An executive who is perceived to be twice as effective as another, can demand 5 times the salary.\n\nAs the world becomes a smaller place, comparison becomes easier. Consequently, a value proposition based on efficiency faces enormous competition, which can rapidly diminish returns. It can turn the best products in the market into commodities. The only way to guard against this threat is to position ourselves based on effectiveness.\n\nEmpty notebooks lose their value as soon as a competitor can print them more efficiently. A well written book can stay effective for centuries."

    "body": "There are often wide chasms between the engineers who understand the power of their technology and the businessmen who could use it profitably. This chasm was bridged by Bob Metcalfe when he was pitching the value of his invention.\n\nBob Metcalfe had invented the Ethernet and was marketing it using his new company, 3Com. These were early days of computer networking, and Metcalfe sold 3 connected computer terminals, which shared hardware resources such as a hard disk or a printer and were connected using Ethernet. This bunch sold for a hefty sum of $3000.\n\nNevertheless, there were some early adopters for this technology. They bought a few units and set it up in their offices. But they came back to Metcalfe with complaints - the units worked, but were not particularly useful.\n\nMetcalfe understood their point. Three computers connected via email was hardly of use to anybody because the network was too small. He wanted to put this point across convincingly. He realized that with each additional node purchased, his client's cost went up linearly. But he also realized that if the client already had 'n' nodes connected to his network, a newly installed node could communicate with each of the existing 'n' units. Ergo, the potency of the network as a whole would go up by the square of the number of units it had. He plotted this linear increase in cost vs. quadratic increase in value on a graph to show that past a certain number of units, the value of the client's network would overtake the linear increase in costs. The conclusion? The client ought to buy more of Metcalfe's computers! Metcalfe drew this graph up a on slide and pitched away to glory.\n\nThis incident forms the basis for Metcalfe's law today, which states that the value of a telecom network is proportional to the square of its nodes. This law forms the basis for the value of network effects and is best exemplified by Facebook.\n\nThrough this anecdote, Bob Metcalfe demonstrates the art of clearly communicating value to a client - a sublime combination of an engineer's mathematical understanding, a salesman's empathy and an artist's creativity. These are the ingredients of a great pitch.\n\nCredits: Bob Metcalfe's interview on the Tim Ferriss Show"

We can only picture the best-case scenarios in every situation. With unforeseen consequences, come several negative consequences - last-minute pressure, crashing schedules and quality compromises. Besides, in a fast changing world, rigid long-term planning is always a risk.\n\nEnter process orientation. Process orientation is focused less on overarching goals, and more on rituals and routines that ensure ongoing course correction. It trades rigid determinism for alertness and flexibility. It is input-centric, and fosters consistency and discipline. It proceeds from a belief that doing the right things everyday, automatically leads us to desirable ends.  The pace of change today is set by the high-tech industry,  which has already deemed the goal oriented waterfall development methodology obsolete. Process oriented agile methods have all but uprooted them.\n\nThis fact is just as relevant to our personal lives. While the quintessential interview question has been, \"where do you see yourself in five years\", one that is more pertinent today is, \"can you mention one regular practice that has helped you build your professional capabilities?\""

    "body": "Our world celebrates only the end product, and increasingly so.\n\nWe know Jerry Seinfeld merely through his stage performances or sitcoms. The little that we know of Lionel Messi is through his performance on the football field.  Our knowledge of Leonardo DiCaprio come from glimpses from his movies. Steven Wilson is but the voice of Porcupine Tree and its front-man.\n\nOur entire understanding of most world-class performers happens through a narrow lens that is laser focused on their end product. This is becoming more prevalent in a shrinking world with smaller attention spans. The internet ensures that we watch about hundred loops of Christiano Ronaldo sprinting across the field, outfoxing 7 players to score. Or that snippet of George Carlin at his hilarious best, circulated endlessly on Facebook feeds.\n\nThis obsessive worship of the end product and its wide exposure appears outwardly beneficial. It elevates us from pedestrian standards to world-class levels. It promises to inspire us by showing us what is possible. But inwardly, it turns inspiration to intimidation. By setting the bar unreasonably high, it ensures that even after significant efforts, we pale in comparison. While cheering us on loudly, with sounds and images of superstars, it whispers to us that we can never be good enough.\n\nBy merely looking at the end product, we have a distorted perception of success. Our engagement with the world's best remains superficial, with us deriving voyeuristic or vicarious pleasure from their success. We often have no idea of what goes into the making of greatness. We do not grapple with the process of how they get there, or the struggles they faced along the way. Any semblance of perfection is a result of years of showing up. The Beatles performed in Hamburg for thousands of hours before becoming a world-wide sensation. Coolio wrote lyrics for 17 years every single day, before his first hit. Van Gogh created 900 paintings, and 1200 sketches through a lifetime of destitution. This list simply goes on an on.\n\nBut to us, they are merely their end products."

    "body": "Writers block has always been a dreadful enemy. There are several writing projects I have thrown away on encountering it. Ideas that seemed clear, compelling and were all but bursting out of my head, simply did not translate into meaningful prose. My blogging was intermittent and my short-stories were incomplete. I left behind a string of work-in-progress projects that I never returned to.\n\nWhy did this happen? Because I was trying to write well every single time. If what resulted did not read well enough, I postponed it and gradually abandoned it.\n\nThe solution is not to give up, but to write badly. This is the advice every veteran writer gives. After some bad writing, the good stuff will flow and what is important to retain this faith.\n\nThe lesson here is not restricted to writing. How to come up with a good business idea? Think of 30 bad ones. How to write a good joke? Write about 10 bad ones. How to make a good composition? Start with a few bad songs.\n\nThe world at large discourages this behaviour. It celebrates the extraordinary and ignores the mediocre. Its indifference transforms faith into fear,  and keeps us from putting our work out. The handful of people who do the opposite, who consistently ship regardless of quality, are world-class performers. To investigate this, one needs to merely look at their earliest work.\n\nThe perfect can oftentimes be the enemy of the good. Under the same circumstances, the bad can be its friend."

    "link": "https://anupamobserved.wordpress.com/2018/03/01/what-makes-written-communication-personal/",
    "body": "It is sheer joy to receive a well written personal email. I received one this week and thought about what goes into creating written communication that moves us. Among various reasons, the most important aspect of meaningful written communication is the effort involved in crafting it.\n\nThis effort could be physical. A hand written letter has to be drafted in rough and rewriting neatly and legibly. It has to be sealed in an envelope, addressed, stamped and posted. The explicit need for this physical effort has been all but eliminated in our digital world. Nevertheless, it feels great to receive a postcard or a handwritten letter because somebody took the pains to send it.\n\nBut there is another type of effort - one that is emotional. Translating our emotions, feelings and individuality into words involves effort. So does refining a draft, structuring it and editing it until the words convey what we feel. Seth Godin calls this emotional labour. Emotional effort translated into the written word moves us for the same reason - because somebody cared enough to do it.\n\nThe forms of written communication we use today can be categorized based on the amount of physical or emotional labour that goes into crafting them.\n\n \n\nThe Letter quadrant (High physical, high emotional): The most potent form communication in its ability to move us. Hand written letters go here. They have become so unusual that they would be perceived as awkward. This awkwardness partly arises from the thought of making a connection that is so personal.\n\nThe Email quadrant (Low physical, high emotional): Electronic communication aims to minimize all of the physical effort that goes into creating written communication. But a well worded email does this while preserving the high amount of emotional effort that goes into creating it. By encouraging us to edit and rephrase, it even contributes to it.\n\nThe Postcard quadrant (High physical, low emotional): There is still the effort involved in purchasing and posting a postcard, but the message is usually a fleeting \"hello\", or \"this reminded me of you\".\n\nThe IM quadrant (Low physical, low emotional): The most prevalent form of communication today. We can do it from the comfort of our couch or say something on the go in 10 seconds. IM, and Whatsapp sit squarely here. It helps us keep in touch, but rarely moves us.\n\nThe high effort quadrants are worth taking note of. The Email quadrant prioritizes emotional effort, by eliminating physical effort. I am yet to send a single personal handwritten letter, but I am looking forward to it. All the while, I hope to minimize my interaction on the IM quadrant to free up capacity for the other three.\n\nWritten communication has evolved a lot since the time homing pigeons. As we forge ahead, however, it is important to not leave the meaningful behind."

There are also a couple of vegetarian ones, which I flip thorough while waiting for my food.\n\nOn the surface, they add to the restaurant's aesthetics. Naturally, these books put their most appealing dish on the cover. More implicitly, the decoration stimulates appetite. It signals that the restaurant is run by connoisseurs. It primes guests for its food to taste better. After all, the tongue can but give us combinations of five basic tastes. The rest is the territory of the mind.\n\nDecorating restaurants with recipe books is a brilliant idea. Rather than restrict itself to the taste of its guests, the restaurant reaches out to their imagination."

    "body": "What does the word \"sensitive\" bring to mind?\n\nMy first impression is that of a sensitive person - somebody who is subordinate to their moods, and with whom one must carefully choose their words.  Used as an adjective for a person, the word sensitive has negative connotations.\n\nWith my engineer's hat on, it has a different meaning. Sensitivity is the ability of an instrument to detect the smallest change in the measured value. A sensitive instrument can be used to make fine measurements, and this is a positive attribute.\n\nThe roots of the word itself lie in the Latin word sensitivus, which translates to being capable of sensation. Sensitivity, therefore, can further ends that are good or bad depending on what we do with it. It can be a disposition that causes us to react to situations without thinking them through. Or it can be used as a radar that tells us about what moves us profoundly - like being filled with a rush of happiness during a trek, or the inexplicable tears that flow in the middle of a concert or an opera.\n\nIt all depends on the framing - whether one is a sensitive person, driven by their sensitivity or a person who uses their sensitivity as an instrument to understand the world, and ultimately, themselves."

The first option affords a lot of choice. To run 'regularly' is open-ended. It offers flexibility, but when it is time to go for a run, 10 things that seem more urgent can take priority. To run 5 km everyday is definite. Most importantly, the need to run is established just as surely as the sun rises. There is no other choice.\n\nWe live in the era of possibilities, with shrinking distances, merging cultures and empowering technologies. Possibilities are ideal for discovery - among a thousand pursuits, to pick that one that most excites us. However, this choice is also the enemy of depth. The moment our pursuit becomes a little harder, there is an endless menu of alternatives that seem more appealing.\n\nWith this blog, what has helped me the most is the need to post everyday, which has ensured that I keep it up for more than 40 days now. Along the way, it has transformed from a choice to a habit - a daily action that is just as sure as bathing or brushing my teeth.\n\nDepth is what transforms a fleeting whim into a meaningful pursuit, and choice is its biggest enemy."

    "body": "This Friday evening, as I was riding the subway, five dark-haired Italian boys entered the compartment. One of them gestured with his arms and made a loud announcement. \n\n\"We're here to give you one hell of a performance. A concerto!\"\n\nHis companions whipped out a trumpet and a couple of Flugelhorns (small brass trumpets). One of them switched on a portable karaoke machine.They were off! The machine bellowed out the background for When the Saints go marching in. Their instruments hummed to life. Their faces exuded confidence, and so did their every move. The audience was captivated, with one lady recording the performance on her phone. Barely 30 seconds in, a boy went around with a cup, collecting money. In a minute or so, they had sung the chorus and brandished a few extrapolations on their instruments. The next station came around and they disappeared as quickly as they entered.\n\nNow if the lady who recorded this performance (and paid about €3 for it), were to look at it again on her phone, she would realize several things. The length of the video would be about 40 seconds or so, of which the first portion is merely a build up. Most of the music actually came from the karaoke machine, with the boys just topping it off with uncoordinated notes. Their solo in the end was but a cacophonous flurry of random notes. The performers were amateur musicians. They performed their little trick and were out quicker than the audience could see it.\n\nOn the surface, this seems like deception. Their build-up was excessive. Their music was sub-standard, and mostly machine made. Their performance was short. They promised more than what they actually offered.\n\nBut there is more to this than meets the eye. They came in the guise of musicians, but performed like magicians. They were quick, but they delighted the audience enough to part with their money. They were salesmen whose skill could only be sensed, but not described.\n\nThat skill is called charm."

At work, I tackled each task as it flowed through the mailbox, rather than planning in advance. Everything seemed like a drag. I could clearly sense how much longer I took for getting things done. After the frustration of spending an entire work day this way, I was curious as to what had hijacked it.\n\nOn certain occasions, my motivation is sucked away, my energy levels drop, and my productivity is sapped without any clear reason. More often than not, this happens on Mondays after lazy Sundays, or when I work from home, or when my morning routine is disturbed.\n\nOur routines and rituals for any given day prime us for optimal performance, and sets us up for success. It is when this daily discipline is broken, that our productivity drops. This is also true on a weekly basis - days and weeks are the two rhythms that define the passage of our time. Unless we have a renewing weekend, Mondays can feel like being woken up with a bucket of cold water.\n\nRoutines are often perceived to be boring, with the pretext that they do not allow for spontaneity. I would argue against this. Our routines help us to bring our best versions to a particular situation. That, for me, represents living in the moment far better than a party that lasts into the morning and leaves us with a hangover for the next couple of days.\n\nThe next time you have a slow day or a slow Monday, ask yourself how you started that day or how you spent the weekend before."

    "body": "Why do established, well-run companies get disrupted by innovation?\n\nCould it be because the pace of technology is too fast? Could they not be listening to their customers? Is it because they are complacent or become incompetent with size?\n\nIt turns out that all of these plausible, but simplistic explanations do not suffice. Clayton Christensen, who coined the term \"disruption\", debunks them in his seminal book - The Innovator's Dilemma. Established companies regularly develop disruptive products as part of their R&D efforts but subsequently shelve them. They hire and nurture the best talent. They are not complacent - they sustain high growth targets to satisfy their shareholders. They organize their incentive structures to delight their most valuable customers.\n\nThen what causes them to fail?\n\nCounter-intuitively, listening to their top customers with a single-minded focus is precisely what causes their failure. When companies are large, their processes are streamlined to serve their top customers, which gives them a lot of momentum. However, the priorities of their most profitable customers could lead these companies away from emerging opportunities that would eventually reconfigure their markets. By the time they realize this, their large momentum would render them incapable of changing direction.\n\nMomentum can be powerful. The profitability it offers helps large companies absorb risks and weather setbacks. Veteran chess players harness momentum from years of immersion in the game to analyze parts of a board holistically, and obtain an insurmountable advantage over beginners. But this momentum only holds so far as the rules of the game do not change. A small variation in how a piece can move, or a change in the layout of the board can cause even grandmasters to lose the advantage they have over rookies.\n\nLearning the rules of the game and training their workforce to play it serves organizations well in an unchanging world. But playing the same moves when the rules of the game have changed can lead to disaster.\n\nKnowing whether or not the rules have changed is what constitutes their dilemma.\n\nCredits: The Innovator's Dilemma by Clayton Christensen"

Religions are stories that convey spiritual truths. Treacherous expeditions like transatlantic voyages were sparked by a story of riches and spices across the ocean. Organizations today are centered around certain truths - market needs that can be met for a profit. On identifying this need, stories are created to convey it, such as mission statements, sales targets and key performance indicators. Organizations are stories themselves. They exist only in our imagination.\n\nBut with time, we start mistaking the stories for the truth. This can lead to the narrowing of our minds, cause our stories to collide and result in religious fundamentalism. This also causes companies to a focus on quick returns and short-term efficiency over long-term plans that emphasize effectiveness. Eventually, a newcomer who is not burdened by these stories disrupts established organizations. The consequence is inevitably suffering.\n\nStories are powerful. They are the glues that bind us to a common objective. However, it is important to build the awareness to test our stories, and avoid mistaking them for their underlying truth. Only organizations that do this regularly can survive in an ever-changing environment.\n\nCredits: Sapiens by Yuval Noah Harari"

While starting a car, the maximum torque is needed to move the first couple of meters. On waking up, putting one's feet on the ground is what requires the greatest effort. The first steps also have a disproportionate influence on the result. Our brain develops for the most part in the first three years of our lives. What we receive during this time compounds over our lives to makes us the people we are.\n\nRegardless of its veracity, the German quote makes a compelling point, because the first sentence is that which alters the state of rest or motion of the readers' mind - their inertia."

One year after moving to Germany and working in German, I can try and answer that.\n\nIn India, my learning happened mostly through reading or listening. I was learning German using its English translations in a remote setting. If I read a news article, I would decipher words like \"attacker\", \"arrested\" and \"shot\" (since so much international news is about terrorism) and strengthen them through repetition.\n\nIn Germany, I registered the words I already  knew by listening to people use them. But along with the sound of the word escaping their lips, my mind was bombarded by several other cues: the wrinkles on their foreheads, the movement of their eyebrows, the setting they used it in, the reaction of the people around them and so on.\n\nThe difference is that of a corpse and a living person.\n\nLet me illustrate this with Mahlzeit. Its literal translation is \"Meal-time\". It is said only during lunchtime, and doubles up as a greeting. The more figurative translation is \"Happy lunch-time\". But here's another catch. It is said only at work, because it separates work from leisure - something Germans take very seriously. Now the translation morphs to \"Happy lunch-break\". What is more? It is used predominantly by working class Germans, as a means of expressing their solidarity, indicating that this sacred time cannot be appropriated by their bosses. Try translating that!\n\nBesides, a translated German novel where characters would go around in a factory chanting \"Happy lunch-break\" would call for a change in genre.\n\nFaithful translation requires the rewiring of brains. Translation is futile, unless lobotomy is involved."

This particular phrase stands out to me.\n\nWe have now long established how our childhood plays a dominant role in determining how we interpret the world. The human brain, in comparison to other animals, is far less developed at birth. This is what makes us so adaptable. Most of our intensive brain development happens in the first three years of our lives, after which neural plasticity - the ability to which our brains can be moulded by experiences, starts dropping.\n\nHowever, this also means that our brains were developed to understand a world that is very different from today's world. In my case, this period was the late 80s and the early 90s - a world where the internet did not exist, personal computers were exotic, most knowledge was contained in physical libraries and reading was an indispensable skill. Considering how much the world has changed, our approaches for learning about it - in big classrooms and with textbooks - can be outdated. Sure, we can change that with effort, but the hardware between our ears is less flexible and versatile than it used to be. The older we are, the truer this is of us.\n\nThis is where the lyrics of the song strike a chord with me. Babies that are born today can interpret this world more easily than older people whose brains are mostly developed. No wonder, children born in recent times are termed digital natives, and can understand and adopt new technology more easily. Their brains, developed in the present, are better calibrated to embrace it.\n\nThinking about this makes me regard children with more respect - as people whose methods of understanding the world around are superior to my own."

This public establishment that adorned these lights each evening, was sending a message out to the rest of the world.\n\nAnd what would that mean to the LGBT community? I can only hazard a guess. In a world that misunderstands and marginalizes them, at a time when most governments still do not recognize them, these lights are a welcome exception. Here's a city that empathizes with LBGTs everywhere, and shines these lights out every evening in solidarity - a place that they can call home. It is little wonder that people of all kinds who do not feel understood by the rest of the world move to Berlin.\n\nBut the tragedy is that these lights are the exception and not the norm.

    "body": "I have been posting everyday for the last 50 days. What started off as an experiment has turned into a habit. Here are three lessons that I have learnt along the way:\n\n1. There is no dearth of ideas - When I  started off, I was anxious that I would run out of topics quite soon. Barely a couple of weeks in, I realized that there is an abundance of fascinating things to take note of. The practice of blogging everyday has implicitly made them easier to notice and write about. The challenge lies in expressing these ideas more coherently, rather than finding them in the first place.\n\n2. The mind's background processing can be harnessed - When I have a rough idea in my head, I sit down and try and express it in free-flowing prose. Oftentimes the words I type out would feel inadequate in their expression of my understanding. After a stipulated duration, I force myself to take a break for several hours before I return to the post. When I resume, somehow I find that my expression is clearer. It is as though my mind worked on the problem during the break, without my conscious knowledge.\n\n3. Fear becomes familiar - Every post on the blog brings me face-to-face with fear. The fear of expressing my stand on an issue. The fear of expressing a point of view that can be challenged. The fear of hitting the publish button. By blogging everyday, I understand my fear better by conversing with it. With time, I also realize that fear doesn't go away but merely becomes more familiar.\n\nOne example of Lesson No. 1: each of these three lessons could be spun out as a post of its own.\n\nThanks for tuning in. I will continue putting these out as long as I enjoy doing so. So far, it has been fun!\n\nCredits: Lesson 3 on fear is inspired by the teachings of Seth Godin. He borrows Steven Pressfield's term for terming this fear The Resistance."

    "body": "Goals are good motivators. They give us a clear target to aim at.\n\n\"I hope to finish writing that novel by the end of this year\"\n\nBut goals can be fragile. Orienting ourselves around merely a goal can set us up for failure. No wonder most goals, like new-year resolutions, are not followed through.\n\nThe major problem with goal orientation is optimism bias. Daniel Kanheman and Amos Tversky have demonstrated how we are likely to plan our goals with an extra helping of optimism. This is due to our tendency to imagine good outcomes better than bad ones. However, outcomes in the real world are random, and can throw our estimations off.  No wonder that 90% of large projects have time or budget overruns. When we assume that a particular task can take half an hour, on rare occasions, it takes 20 minutes. But more often than we imagine, it can 2 hours to produce the expected quality. And when that happens, we are likely to get discouraged.\n\nAnother problem is procrastination. When we have ambitious goals, we are likely to encounter obstacles along the way. When this happens, our tendency to wander off and procrastinate is at its highest. Each instance of procrastination makes the ambitious goal even harder to achieve, leading quickly to its abandonment.\n\nSo how do  we strengthen goals? By shifting everyday focus on a process rather than the goal.\n\nWhile output is random, we can control inputs. When we define a regular process for achieving a goal, say daily, or every other day, this offers several advantages. For instance, if the quest were to write a novel, our target could be 30 minutes of focused writing per day, regardless of the output.\n\nHow does this help overcome the challenges mentioned above?\n\nWith process orientation, comes regular positive reinforcement. The day is won, so long as the process has been followed, and this can easily lead to consistency. Consistency leads to habit formation and improves quality over time.\n\nSecondly, process orientation has been shown to counter procrastination effectively. Obstacles are less likely to derail our practice. In our example, reaching a difficult point in our novel's plot need not derail our process of  half-an-hour of daily writing, regardless of quality.\n\nProcess orientation is effective because it bridges the gap between intention and action through a series of small, everyday victories. This regular positive reinforcement, over the long run, can help us meet intended targets, and forge on even if we do not meet them.\n\nAnd this is what makes it an anti-fragile approach."

It just keeps growing on me. Creative writing at its best manifests when we write for our own selves. This is true of most art forms. A writer ought to write such that one of her clones would thoroughly enjoy reading her creations. A painter ought to paint to appeal to his innermost self. Master chefs are adept at tingling every taste-bud that a spoonful of their preparation touches.\n\nOn the face of it, this approach appears to be selfish. Would it not be better to have a wider approach and appeal to people beyond one's own self?\n\nHowever, this self-centric approach is adopted by Tim Urban, the prolific author of the Wait but Why blog. Tim's method involves taking a difficult topic and try to explain it to a football stadium filled with replicas of himself. His aim is to be interesting and funny while appealing to the sensibility of this homogenous army straight out of sci-fi dystopia. Nevertheless, he has reached millions of people of all varieties, and helped them interpret a wide range of complex topics.\n\nHow does that happen?\n\n1. Great art is universal in its appeal. Mozart and Beethoven are appreciated on every continent on the planet. We are all moved by the same great paintings. I do not follow any sport, but I love reading well-written sport stories, because their appeal transcends the bounds of their sport. At our essence, we are really not too different. The idea is to create something that appeals to this essence. And to start doing that, one might as well start with one's self.\n\n2. The internet brings us within reach of an audience which wants exactly what we produce. It offers us the busiest of street corners. It helps us start off by offering us a niche that is identical to us. As we get better, our creations would appeal to a broader audience. This has never been as easy in the past. The internet fills our football stadiums, provided we learn to create something worthwhile.\n\nThe question, then is not how to gather a following, but rather to become better at appealing to our innermost selves with our creation. Each one of us is the best crucible for our own creations. Once they are good enough, outreach becomes a consequence rather than deliberate effort.\n\nInspiration: Tim Urban's interview on the Tim Ferriss Show podcast"

    "body": "There is one scene from the movie 'Ratatouille' that is etched in my memory. The one where Anton, the hard-nosed critic, is at the restaurant to pronounce his judgement. He is expected to write it off as a failure. He is served Ratatouille, a vegetable stew with its roots in French peasantry. The first bite of the dish transports the critic to his childhood. It reminds him of his mother's cooking in their rustic home. This nostalgic flashback moves Anton to declare that he had been served by no less than the finest chef in France.\n\nCal Fussman is one of the world's finest interviewers. His job is to elicit unique insights from illustrious people who have already had thousands of interviews. Several times, Cal teases out things that even his interviewees do not know about themselves. In one interview, he gets Mikhail Gorbachev to open up about how his father's struggles in World War II inspired him to become a beacon of world peace.\n\nBut how are Cal Fussman, Oprah Winfrey and Larry King so good at what they do? How do they elicit such answers?\n\nOne of the key factors is the questions they pose - ones that are aimed for their heart rather than the head. Cal started that interview with Gorbachev with \"what is the best thing your father taught you?\" Their questions operate similarly to the Ratatouille that Anton tasted. It causes their guests to pause, and in three seconds they go through a highlight reel of their life. At the end, they assimilate what they see into a wonderful, and often new insight.\n\nThe result? The interviewer and the audience learn something new and valuable. The guests themselves are delighted to have journeyed through their best moments. Subsequently, they let their guard down and open up with the best stories of their lives.\n\nAsking questions is how we learn most naturally. No wonder toddlers overflow with them, driving parents crazy. However, only a few of us continue to hone in on this tendency and learn to ask the best questions - ones that serve as pathways into people's hearts and their most memorable stories.\n\nInpsiration: Cal Fussman's appearance on the James Altucher Show podcast"

    "body": "Weekends are valuable. They are the chunks of time that we are most in control of. Can we make this cliched question truer to its stated intent? Can we use it to evaluate our weekends, rather than to merely make small talk?  Firstly, let us broadly outline the two kinds of activities we can fill our weekends with.\n\nThere are things that gratify instantly. Like eating that chocolate cake topped off with some rich creamy fudge. Or scrolling through our Twitter or Reddit feeds. Or watching our favourite sport. Or reading a page-turning thriller. What all these activities have in common is their ability to flood the brain with some feel good dopamine the minute they are indulged in. There is an impulsive tendency to reach for them during times of boredom or stress.\n\nAnd then there are activities that delay gratification. Like going for a run, a long bike ride, working out, playing the sport we love or reading non-fiction or classical literature. The idea of pursuing them are appealing, but their execution is difficult. They start off as commitments, but are not usually followed through. A lot of times, they can even feel painful while executing them. The satisfaction comes later, or over their sustained pursuit.\n\nWhat makes for a good weekend?\n\nInstant gratification starts off as pleasure and ends up becoming a craving or even an addiction. With time, these activities rarely end up as capabilities and have the potential to do long-term damage. Delayed gratification begins as pain or struggle, but transforms into a fulfilling skill with time. There are several studies that show how children that are pre-disposed to delay gratification become happier and more successful individuals.\n\nThe nature of gratification can be a useful heuristic to evaluate our weekends - a thumb rule to think of whether its activities were centred around instant or delayed gratification.\n\nSo how was your weekend?"

    "body": "Einstein: Truth, then, or beauty, is not independent of man?\nTagore: No, I do not say so.\nEinstein: If there were no human beings any more, the Apollo Belvedere no longer would be beautiful?\nTagore: No!\nLast December, I was discussing the nature of reality with my favourite teacher. He informed me of a conversation on the same topic between Rabindranath Tagore and Albert Einstein, which he had called a meeting between the greatest of mystics and the most intelligent of men. Tagore insists in the excerpt above, that the truth of reality depends absolutely on the existence of an observer - a conscious being.\n\nCreation is comprised of the observable and its observers, considered in conjunction. An observation is the ability of an observer to perceive creation. It is possessed by all beings, with humans arguably having it to the highest degree. The keener our observation, the more accurate our perception of reality is.\n\nThere are several ways to improve one's power of observation. John Ruskin sought to do so by sketching. He quoted\nLet two persons go out for a walk; the one a good sketcher, the other having no taste of the kind. Let them go down a green lane. There will be a great difference in the scene as perceived by the two individuals. The one will see a lane and trees; he will perceive the trees to be green, though he will think nothing about it; he will see that the sun shines, and that it has a cheerful effect; and that’s all! But what will the sketcher see? His eye is accustomed to search into the cause of beauty, and penetrate the minutest parts of loveliness. He looks up, and observes how the showery and subdivided sunshine comes sprinkled down among the gleaming leaves overhead, till the air is filled with the emerald light. He will see here and there a bough emerging from the veil of leaves, he will see the jewel brightness of the emerald moss and the variegated and fantastic lichens, white and blue, purple and red, all mellowed and mingled into a single garment of beauty. Then come the cavernous trunks and the twisted roots that grasp with their snake-like coils at the steep bank, whose turfy slope is inlaid with flowers of a thousand dyes.\nRuskin's underlying idea was to engage with the world more closely. Sketching was his means to achieve that end. The practice of sketching sets a sketcher up for observing the world around her more carefully. This would start off as a deliberate practice and with time and repetition, evolve into an unconscious habit.\n\nMy means to achieve the same end is writing. I seek to do this by writing about my world of books, podcasts, conversations and everyday experiences. Some of it goes into this blog. While the blog started off as a vague idea that I felt I should pursue, writing for a few days has made its reasons clearer to me.\n\nWhat is also clear is that my ability to observe is merely infantile today, and I have miles to go. Nevertheless, it is a journey that I look forward to.\n\nAnd it is always great to have a journey to look forward to.\n\nInspiration:\n1. On the nature of reality - Albert Einstein in conversation with Rabindranath Tagore\n2. Why we should draw more (and photograph less) - The school of life"

    "body": "The concept of a remainder has fascinated me ever since I was taught long division. The remainder is what is left after the denominator has taken away everything it can from the dividend.\n\nWhen I crave for ice-cream, I look up parlours nearby. I discover that Victoria ice-cream is rated high on Yelp and Google Maps. I also remember a friend in the neighbourhood recommending their Marzipan and Belgian chocolate flavours. I decide to go there for dessert after lunch.\n\nI taste my first spoonful of the ice-cream sundae. Then a second and then the third one. What am I tasting? What am I experiencing?\n\nFirstly, there are my expectations. These are influenced by what caused my ice-cream craving - perhaps a stressful week at work. Then there are bars set by the reviews I have read and the weight of my friend's recommendation. There is also the collective impression of all the fine ice-cream I have eaten in the past -  from Swensen's parlour in Bangalore to Suso Gelatoteca in Venice, and how this sundae fares in comparison.\n\nSecondly, there is my conditioning, both natural and nurtured. How the human mind responds to a frozen, flavoured, sugary concoction of milk and cream slurped by the tongue. There is the place ice-cream holds in our imagination and our culture today - one that is so different from the recipe Marco Polo brought back to Italy from China. There is my personal sentiments with ice-cream as a dessert that reminds me of eating out with my family. There is the impression that the ambience of Victoria ice-cream's satin red interiors has on my psyche at that moment.\n\nOnce all of these divisors are taken away their share, what remains is my actual perception of the ice-cream cone in my hand, for what it actually is."

Somebody is waging a quiet war against passive voice usage.\n\nTrue to its name, it is uncanny how much life active voice brings to a sentence. Nevertheless, several years of lethargic and sloppy writing has rendered me an inveterate passive voice user. I even harboured the illusion that using the passive voice made my writing sound cleverer. I see my folly now, and I have changed my mind. But changing my behaviour proves much harder. The status quo is a stealth bomber.\n\nBehavioural science: The easiest way to change behaviour is to make the intended action easier to perform.\n\nSo who is waging the war against passive voice? Microsoft Word. Its weapon of choice? A wavy blue line. Recent versions underline every second sentence I type out, nudging me into active voice revisions.\n\nSure, it can be annoying to be corrected so often. I can turn this feature off if I want to. But it is active by default, and that makes all the difference."

    "body": "We are the only future-facing species on the planet.\n\nThe ability to orient itself towards a better future is a defining trait of homo-sapiens. This is thanks to our frontal lobes, which are unique to our brains. To test this out, Dan Gilbert proposes a thought experiment - if we were told that about four children were killed in Haifa or Beirut two days ago, we would feel bad. If we were told that four children will be killed the next day, we would feel miserable.\n\nThe function of the pre-frontal cortex is to simulate experiences. Our present selves behave like custodians to our future selves - planning our finances, putting money away for our retirement and exercising to remain fit. All of this future orientation is central to what caused humans to hijack the food chain and become the dominant species 70,000 years ago. Leaning forward is our evolutionary forte. It is our unique blessing.\n\nBut what are some of its hidden costs?\n\nLeaning forward forces us to make bets on how the future would turn out. These bets gradually turn into our expectations. Expectations lead to happiness or disappointment depending on whether they are satisfied. Increasingly, it is becoming harder for human beings to predict futures in a world that changes at a blinding pace. Chronic depression of free people in developed economies, is also unique to our species. It is our unique curse.\n\nThe alternative is to have a grounding in the present moment. This is what mindfulness seeks to achieve - to appreciate the present moment for what it is, and not for how we expected it to be. To eliminate expectation is to be truly free.\n\nBesides, a truer understanding of our present, sets us up for a better future."

    "link": "https://anupamobserved.wordpress.com/2018/03/22/who-controls-information-quality/",
    "body": "How has the quality of information that reaches us changed with time? People often lament that in the yesteryear, newspapers, magazines and even music, was of higher quality. Are they merely being nostalgic, or are they right?\n\nEarlier, publishing came with big costs. This was because the medium was scarce. Vinyl discs were expensive to produce, and to create and publish music was difficult. Every piece of writing had to be printed on paper. This involved cost and effort. Bookstores had limited shelf-space and every author had to earn her right to deserve a place on it.\n\nThis scarcity translated to a mechanism of quality control by the creators of the information themselves. It was difficult to reach members of the audience, and once they were reached, it was precious to keep them and not lose their trust. Therefore, there was huge premium for quality, and newspaper editors, book publishers and record label producers worked hard to sustain it.\n\nToday, publishing is free - the internet has made it so. There is no quality control anymore. Anybody can reach out and interrupt anybody else with information. What this means is that everybody has a voice. But this also means that all the voices that reach you are not curated for quality or accuracy. There are no high stakes to protect any more.\n\nAs a consumer of information, what does this mean for you?\n\nIt means that the onus for controlling information quality shifts to you. Today, it is important to ask yourself whether the information that reaches you is in line with whatever you seek. Whether it is information that serves your best interests when you pay attention to it. In a world where connections are free, you are responsible for the quality of information you consume. Information curation is a skill that is becoming invaluable. We might not be far away from a day where books on Amazon are free, and we pay for the recommendations.\n\nWhat this also means, is if the quality of information you consume does not live up to your standards, you bear the responsibility to change that.\n\nInspiration: Seth Godin's conversation with Cal Fussman."

    "body": "What is writer's block?\n\nIt is sitting at the table to write, but not having the words to follow through. Anybody who has written for a while has experienced it. I have experienced it several times. I still do, as I type out these words. More broadly, this can be called the artist's block, because every creative profession seems to suffer from it. But what makes these professions unique? Why do plumbers not have plumber's block? Why do carpenters not have carpenter's block? Few things could be more disastrous than surgeon's block!\n\nThis is partly because of the inherent randomness of the quality of output in creative processes. By definition, creativity does not follow a set process. Creativity taps into a different part of the brain than the one used to perform logical, repeatable processes.  No wonder that albums released by musicians, different works of painters, and books published by authors can vary so widely in the quality of their output.\n\nBut this variation alone is not enough. Additionally, there is the tendency to hold on to one's last good piece of work. The tendency to allow build one's perception around \"a hit\" and the tendency to not fall down from these standards. Again, the wiring of our brain is to blame here. Our tribalistic need to protect our reputation has helped us survive through our evolution. It now holds us back by inducing fear into our next creative project by whispering to us, \"if you can't make it better, you are better off not trying\". Moreover, the better we get, the louder this voice whispers.\n\nThis combination of wide variation in quality, and clinging to one's best work is what causes the crippling phenomenon of writer's block. All prolific artists who overcome writer's block embrace bad work. They approach the creative process like a routine. They realize that the only way to write better than their best work, is to follow through with 5 bad ones, so that the 6th work will rise to the occasion.\n\nAnd by doing so, they kill writer's block before it kills them.\n\nInspiration: Seth Godin's excellent podcast - Akimbo"

Is this beneficial? Is this better? Is there some progress? The central idea is comparison among different things or to a standard. To judge is to interpret things in relation to how we want them or expect them to be.\n\nWe are born with the tendency to observe and be curious. This innate quality morphs into judgement with time.

I had finished 15 minutes faster than my best training time on India's hardest urban run.\n\nWhat had I done differently that day? Just one thing - I had run alongside an expert pacer from the start line to the finish line. In distance running, a pacer is a seasoned runner who knows the track well enough to consistently finish it with a stipulated timing (they usually run with a flag bearing this timing). During uphills, my pacer ensured that we were slow and preserved our energy. On downhills, we relaxed and used gravity to step up our pace.\n\nPacing can be applied to events we face at work almost everyday - presentations and meetings. Pacing can be a force multiplier, that determines how useful a meeting can be for the entire group in attendance. What makes pacing so crucial?\n\nIn meetings, different parties necessarily have different perspectives. If everybody was on the same page, there would be no need for the meeting. The only absolute measure they have in common is the meeting's time. Time is equally ruthless to the CEO and the intern at the meeting table. Pacing serves as the bridge that reconciles the subjective world of each attendee to that objective measure of time.\n\nAnd by doing so, pacing can be the difference between bettering one's training performance, and having everyone wish they had their time back."

    "body": "\"But those who do not observe the movements of their own minds must of necessity be unhappy.\" - Marcus Aurelius\nThis quote is from Marcus Aurelius' journal. What is the Roman emperor trying to convey through this 2000 year old entry?\n\nTo decode this, let us put the evolution of our minds into perspective. First came two billion years of evolution. The brain emerged as a central unit for coordination for a number of automatic responses, and was walnut sized even in gigantic dinosaurs. Rodents appeared about 60 million years back and are smart enough to navigate mazes for treats. Throughout this period, living organisms were merely puppets of their brain.\n\nThe human brain in its present form is about 70,000 years old. The first documented knowledge of the brain as the seat of our intelligence and thinking is around 2500 years old. By labelling this part of our brain as our \"mind\", we successfully separated our \"self\" from it. Up to this point, the mind had used the self as its instrument.\n\nWe now live in a world where several parts of the brain have names. We have moved from the world of jungles to that of armchairs. We discover free-will and realize that we have been running on auto-pilot for millions of years. Free-will is the power of the self to choose a response for a given stimulus. Therefore, free-will can be defined as the extent to which the self can use the mind as an instrument.\n\nThe wise Roman emperor realized that in order to be happy, we need to use our minds just as we use instruments. Any useful instrument needs to be calibrated, and to calibrate something is to observe its movements. This is what he conveys through his 2000 year old journal entry. We now have the luxury of plopping down on our armchairs and observing how the mind moves. We learn about its potential, and also its absurdities. Like how it responds to public speaking just as it would have to a saber-toothed tiger darting out from the bush.\n\nAnd this process of observation this is what we call \"meditation\" - the befitting name for Marcus Aurelius' ancient journal."

It keeps me from constantly juggling with information in my head. This applies to shopping lists, to-do lists, as well as to problems and concerns that plague my head. Writing helps imprison them on paper, or in more recent times, behind a screen. It helps me look at these items and prioritize them. Whatever festers as a demon in my head eventually turns into a mere trifle after I write it down.\n\nSecondly, it helps me step above information and observe the patterns that emerge. Journals, blogs and articles help their authors ideate by doing so. Along with this clarity comes accountability. I am forced to think and express my ideas coherently, since it is impossible to take back what I have written.\n\nMost importantly, writing gives us feedback on what our thoughts look like. Unlike spoken words, which fade away, written words stare back like reflections from a mirror. Thereafter, writing enables us to go back and revise what we express, closing the loop. By editing our sentences, we are also rewiring our brain.\n\nWriting is one of our oldest triumphs as a species. At the same time, it is sorely underrated. Only a handful of people utilize it. There is scope yet for a writing revolution - where each person writes everyday just as surely as they bathe or brush their teeth."

These prayers are poetry put to practice and handed down across several centuries.\n\nBut that we chant these poems, and do not read them, boggles my mind.\n\nFor most of my life, I have worn a thread around my chest and recited these hymns, just because people around me told me that it was the right thing to do. I did not question their intent often enough, and when I did, I received dead-ends. I did not understand a word of what they meant. I merely memorized them and reproduced their sounds, like a parrot would. That millions of smart people still do this routinely boggles my mind. Poetry is meant to be read, and not recited. It is funny how many poetry and shloka \"recitation\" competitions I have participated in. Not one of them emphasized on engagement with the underlying poetry.\n\nHabits can be powerful. They set the mind and body on auto-pilot, to perform certain tasks without wasting cognitive effort. Nevertheless, a habit or ritual is only a means. It is important to investigate what they lead to. They could set up a practice of going for a run every morning, and just as easily, for smoking a cigarette everyday after lunch.\n\nTherefore, the ends that our habits achieve, ought to be regularly tested. Since we are are not likely to catch the biases that propagate our habits, an outside perspective would help. Such as that friend who is not afraid to call your bullshit or to ones who are retain their childlike ability to ask the most basic questions.\n\nBecause a habit of chanting poetry does disservice to both the poems as well as the chanter."

Our waiter was friendly to an unusual degree. He walked over every fifteen minutes to check on us. He doled out lavish praises every time we ordered something. Towards the end, he offered us some tea and baklava on the house. When all the dishes were cleared, he came over to us and paused. He leaned forward, lowered his voice and asked us for a favour.\n\n\"Could you review the restaurant on Tripadvisor. And could you also add my name to your review?\"\n\nHe spelled out his name on a card and stayed at the table, insisting we do this right away. A couple of us whipped out our phones and left a good review. We then left the restaurant. On the way back to our hotel, we discussed how we would never dine in that restaurant again.\n\nWhat had happened above was interesting. We experienced bad service, but we left a good review. By doing so, we had slightly diluted the quality of a public resource that we ourselves rely on. From the restaurant's perspective, our decision to not go back would not hurt them - we were tourists after all. Our review, on the other hand, is likely to give them two or three more customers, perpetuating this system of manipulation. We were not alone either. Several other people had left that restaurant and its waiter very positive reviews.\n\nWhat causes people to be manipulated in this manner?\n\nReciprocity is a strong impulse that is ingrained into human beings. It is the urge to return a favour to somebody who has done us a good turn. It is burned into our genes. It  was needed to keep us in strong tribal bonds to ensure our survival. Today, it is the implicit glue in an elaborate society that is based more than ever on giving and taking from strangers.\n\nNevertheless, our tendencies for reciprocity can be exploited. One restaurant in Istanbul has learned to deal with cut-throat competition by doing so. To break these systems, or at the very least not contribute to them, it always helps to ask ourselves if there is anybody we are doing a disservice with our favours."

It had mosaics of Jesus, his disciples, Archangel Gabriel and so on. When the Ottoman empire took over in the 15th century, they had no use for a church - they needed a mosque instead. But they did not raze the structure down and build afresh. They covered the mosaic with plaster (Islam prohibits all imagery within a prayer hall), added minarets, built a mihrab (prayer niche) and used the building as a mosque. They did not even rename the building - Hagia Sophia, which translates to Holy Wisdom, suits Islam just as well. Today, Turkish mosques everywhere are designed based on the Byzantine style of domed architecture, with its roots in orthodox Christianity.\n\nThe beauty of historical cities come in different shades. They can be homogeneous like Paris, which was destroyed in a fire and rebuilt in uniform shades of white and grey. Or they can be like Istanbul: an amalgamation of the old and the new, churches and mosques, Christianity and Islam, and Europe and Asia. The Turkish sultans celebrated this heterogeneity with pragmatism and open-mindedness. And by doing so, they have handed down to us this architectural wonder of 6th century AD that took a mere 5 years to build.\n\nIn an age where the new, the shiny and the young are increasingly given precedence,the Hagia Sophia reminds us to exercise the requisite discretion to retain the old that is valuable."

    "body": "Why is there often disdain for sales and business teams from the engineers and technologist that build the products?\n\nTechnologists have the impression that they do all the hard work of creating a product or a solution, whereas the business guys do the easy part. A good product sells itself, and a bad product falls apart in the market quickly. So where does the sales guys contribute?\n\nWell, if it were that simple, there would be no need for sales teams. Companies that build good products and solutions, would succeed without sales and set the standards. But that does not quite materialize.\n\nSo what does sales do? Having been a technologist first, and on the business side later, I can take a shot at answering that.\n\nThe theory behind today's technologies is complicated. But once a technology has been realized, it is replicable at scale. While it takes decades to master the disciplines to invent a new technology, it is easier to sustain it. This is because technology theory is perfect, and its systems are predictable. All the theory that goes into building a smartphone is difficult to master, but building one is not as hard in practice. And this is as true for building it in India, China or the Dominican Republic.\n\nOn the other hand, business theory is simple. It is obvious that good communication leads to strong relationships. But executing it can take decades of practice and perfecting. Sales involves human behaviour, which is unpredictable. The recipe for the right skills and processes are dependent on an assortment of variables such as geography, culture, time, and the temperament of the individuals involved. These skills are difficult to scale or replicate. The same sales strategy for selling a smartphone in China today would simply crumble in India, or even in China 10 years from now. All these factors also make seemingly obvious business theory imperfect, and impossible to perfect.\n\nThe mistake made by most technologists is to look at how simple business theory and mistake it for being complete, obvious and easy to implement. They do not realize how many years of practice go into performing a sale that looks easy.\n\nIn summary, the technological world of difficult theory and easy implementation fails to understand the business world of simple theory and difficult implementation.\n\nInspiration: Zero to One - Peter Thiel"

    "body": "Choosing, in most cases, is wasteful. The more non-critical the purchase, the more trivial choice becomes.\n\nI registered this with greater emphasis when we moved from a furnished to an unfurnished house. Let us consider curtains, for example. When we furnish a house ourselves, we are likely to invest a lot more time and effort in going through the available curtain choices, selecting a few and comparing between them. In a furnished house, we receive a choice that was already made. In my experience, the default choice is, in most cases, good enough. The same holds true also if a friend were to gift us curtains. I am likely to appreciate their selection just as much.\n\nThis is an important point because purchase decisions come with hidden costs.\n\nFirstly, the cognitive decision-making ability can be gainfully used elsewhere. Secondly, there is often a drop in our satisfaction levels after making a careful choice. Past an optimal point, it has been proven that increase in choice makes it harder and less satisfying to make a decision. The optimal number of choices is far lesser that today's consumerism based market offers us. This phenomenon, where excessive choice can be detrimental, is called the paradox of choice.\n\nThe bottom line? When presented with choice, especially for non-critical purchases, just choose the first thing you like. Going through the entire selection actually undermines the final choice you make. Another way to express the paradox of choice: past a handful of choices, the harder you look, the lesser you gain from doing so.\n\nInspiration: The paradox of choice - Barry Schwarz"

I rated it about 6 or 7 on 10 because there were parts of it that were melodramatic and imperfect. I remembered deciding that it wasn't worth another watch.\n\nThis time, I saw how it was an allegory. It shows us how living one day differently from the patterns of our normal behaviour could be so valuable. I could see how sublime an actor Jim Carrey was - how he could simultaneously tap into his natural quirky and animated self, while portraying his character to the fullest essence.\n\nWhat I ignored this time was the cheesy portions - the part where he chases down an aeroplane or wins an impossible court case. The parts that I would have referred to 10 years ago as imperfections. Now, I recognize that those portions are meant to appeal to other sections of the audience. I recognize that they for me to leave out, rather than dilute my experience.\n\nThis lesson is not specific to movies alone. In any experience, it pays to discern between the part that is meant for engagement, and the part that is meant to be ignored.\n\nBecause the portions we leave out liberate us to enjoy the portions we engage with to the fullest."

Moreover, the Byzantines were experts at erecting defenses, having established and controlled Constantinople - that pivotal gateway between the Orient and the Occident. Byzantine buildings had the characteristic blue, striped tiles that adorn the dome of the Hagia Sophia - a wonder of the medieval world.\n\nLast week, I visited Istanbul - the great city that was formerly Constantinople. What started as impressions of a computer game, were consummated as a real-life experience. I learned about how the Turks adopted the Byzantine domes in constructing their mosques. And there was more - I realized how everything named Osmania in Hyderabad, from a university, a reservoir to a popular biscuit had Ottoman roots (Osman in Turkish is Ottoman).\n\nAs human beings we derive great pleasure from recognizing patterns. This ecstatic joy allows us to engage with useful information, remember it better and apply it to our lives. This is precisely what education is meant to enable. The role of a teacher, then, is to show their students these patterns and spark wonder in their eyes. If history is boring, it indicates, above all, a failure to do so.

It also tells me the hotel's need to save its ass. But herein lies a problem of percentages.\n\nOf the thousands of guests that the hotel hosts, it would take a really rare one to sue them for an accident along a recommended running route. Furthermore, the odds of such a crazy person actually encountering an accident and winning the legal battle that follows are remarkably remote.\n\nBut contrast this with the high percentage of guests who are likely to read this card. The card sends a signal to every guest that the hotel feels they are likely enough to be the crazy person described above. Thereby, the disclaimer dilutes their experience at the hotel ever so slightly. Also, being in the hospitality business does not help the hotel here.\n\nEvery touchpoint with a guest influences their experience - the design of the lobby, the cleanliness of the lift, the friendliness of the receptionist and disclaimers on cards. Sure, every hotel needs to protect itself against psychotic customers and an imperfect legal system. But what is the best means to do so? Is it to leave a card that \"assumes no responsibility\" for a freak injury?\n\nI would think otherwise."

He embodies his truth, and has written about it in Linchpin and elsewhere.\n\nOn the surface, this notion of everybody being their own superhero appeals to me. Deep down, I didn't believe in it. From my experience, I had seen people develop different capabilities. Some people were better at math than others. Some were born to play the guitar. Some had the ability to zigzag a football field and score whenever they wanted. And then there were some who could do all these things well.\n\nBut in recent times, I have started to see Seth's point.  To do so required me to look at people differently - to see them for who they were, rather than seeing them for who I expected them to be.\n\nA person may not be good at math, guitar or at controlling a football. Those are three parameters that are specific to my arbitrary criterion. Similarly, the whole world imposes criteria on people, just as industries do. These criteria come in the form of syllabi, degrees, job descriptions, and they are tested using assignments, examinations and interviews. But industrial design is built for homogeneity. A bolt on an assembly line is made from the same material and machined in the same fashion as the millions that follow it. Is that to be expected of people as well?\n\nThe more I see the people for who they are, the more I discover their wonderful gifts. There is Ben who didn't complete his education, but offers courses in creative coding to universities in Berlin. There is my aunt who quit her government job after 40, learnt swimming and is a national veteran swimming champion today. Or a friend who quit a lucrative consulting job, and creates wonderful short stories everyday. There is no dearth of such examples.\n\nWhat we look for depends on what we believe in. If our educational and professional systems hold people to an arbitrary standard, we will receive a ranking of how well people conform to it.

An unsavoury conclusion was that these tweets were my subtle way of showing off - of telling the world I was hopping across airports. This might not be the real reason, but it is certainly plausible. Moreover, all of this happened unconsciously. Only in retrospect, after keeping away from twitter for several months, did this thought even present itself.\n\nThis particular realization could be harmless. But it is certainly a symptom. I might be doing performing several other actions with consequences that are not as inconsequential. The problem is that I simply do not know what they are. How do I have them called out?\n\nI could ask my friends or family. But most of them they are biased, and are likely to view my actions as favourable. Our friends are the thin slice of people who like us enough to voluntarily share portions of their lives with us. This problem exists with our families as well. The better the members of our family get to know us, the more they are predisposed to either like us or hide criticism of us for the fear of disturbing an important relationship.\n\nBut there are exceptions here - the ones who are discerning enough to spot our flaws, care enough about us to point it out and are courageous enough to express them bluntly. They could come in different forms: colleagues who suggest how to do something better, mentors who care about our well being, friends who are courageous enough to call our bullshit and people who see the world differently from us and express their disagreement.

Nevertheless, we can fly anywhere today, in the safest possible manner - a marvelous feat considering we have a mere 100 year aerial legacy. How did we get here so fast?\n\nFirstly, there are unrelenting aviation standards. I often crib about how every modern airport looks just the same. However, standardized airports contribute to keeping aviation safety at a level that land and naval transportation are yet to match. It is imperative that every pilot and control tower speak the same language and the ground staff at every airport follow the same rituals.\n\nAnd then, there is the accelerated learning from doing something well at scale. One plane completing ten successful journeys is followed by three more. In no time, there would be a hundred pilots flying a cumulative hundred days for each passing day. All these planes are served by a system learns from every near-miss, every accident and every disaster that transpires across the world. Sure, we have been flying for merely a hundred years, but in this time, we have clocked an exponential growing number of hours in the sky. A good system, deployed at scale, can multiply the timeline.\n\nSource: ICOA\n\nAt the same time, aviation isn't a very profitable business. It is yet another marvel that in the face of dwindling profits, this system hasn't compromised safety in a world where economics often taken precedence even over human lives.\n\nThe aviation industry, amidst all the jokes thrown at it in the form of cramped seats, bad airline food and its awkward safety procedure demonstrations, quietly sends millions of people soaring through the stratospheres in the comfort of their armchairs. And in doing so, it is a shining example of a well operated system run at scale, that prioritizes safety above everything else.\n\nPerhaps the digital world can gather a few useless lessons from it."

It is interesting how this sequence starts slowly, creeps upwards and catches us by surprise. It starts off flat, slower than even a linear series. But by the 14th term (233), it leaves behind the series of squares and by the 23rd term, it overtakes the cubic series. I sketched this graph to understand it better. I was taken aback by how sharply it climbed.\n\nSystems behave similarly to a Fibonacci series. At the beginning, their complexity climbs at a manageable rate. With a few more moving parts thrown in, things can quickly get out of hand.\n\nLinear thinking comes to us naturally, but we are terrible at non-linear thinking. For the same reason, it is easier to multiply a number by 2 in our head than to find its square. This problem lies at the root of why we are terrible at estimating long-term projects.

As these moments unfold, their urgency often compels us to choose the first action that occurs to us. We react rather than respond. Journaling allows us to reexamine these moments and think of alternatives. Each time we do this, we rewire our brain a little.\n\nFor example, a manager could make an excellent presentation, that is well received. During and soon after the presentation, she could feel good and congratulate herself on pulling it off. On revisiting it later, she might see how much she had leaned on the the slides her team had built during the presentation. And when she does this, smugness would be replaced with gratitude.\n\nIn retrospect, I am surprised by how useful this habit has been. Journaling isn't sold well enough to us. We were told that keeping a journal was useful, because successful people do it. Nobody told us why it was useful.\n\nBy keeping a record of my experiences I live my life twice over.

The word 'temptation' brings to mind cakes, sweets, and specific chocolate brands. Nobody associates temptation with exercise. To investigate further, let us define a 'tendency function' - a quantification of how likely we are to reach for something at this moment. Our tendency function is low for exercise and high for junk food.\n\nBut why is that so? If evolution is a continuous process of perfecting something, why does it seem to screw us over here?\n\nFirstly, there is the problem of the rates of change - the rate at which our species changes, vs. how fast we are changing the world around us. We are all born with hardware, whose last major release happened 70,000 years ago. Subsequently, our bodies have changed very little. Every healthy baby born today is suited to lead the life of a hunter gatherer in the African Savannah.\n\nAnd then, there is the matter of supply. In the world of hunter gatherers, rich food was in short supply, and exercise was available in plenty. One had to trek several kilometers to grab a handful of nuts, to chase down an antelope for its liver or harvest a honeycomb, while competing with squirrels, leopards and bears respectively. Therefore, our bodies evolved to prefer exercise much lesser than its rewards, while requiring plenty of it. Our tendency functions were defined accordingly. If it was wired the other way around, we would have run forever before dying of exhaustion.\n\nIn recent times, all that has changed. In just the last two centuries, we have transformed the world into a place that is futuristic for anybody older than 20. Today,  rich food, which has acquired the term junk food, is mass manufactured and available in plenty. There is no shortage of burgers, nougat....and cake! We live in a world that would make Mary Antoinette proud.\n\nThe problem is that our natural rate of change can no longer keep up. Our tendency functions still retain their default values for rich food and exercise.\n\nAnd this is the curse that we inherit as humans in the 21st century. We are burdened to rewrite our 70,000-year-old tendency function. Our goal is to learn to avoid junk food which is available in plenty, and replace it with exercise, which we need in plenty. It is important to realize that this is not our fault - we did not choose to be born into such circumstances. Nevertheless, it is a daunting challenge that we are forced to contend with.\n\nAnd you have my best wishes in responding to it in your own way."

    "body": "Dreams are fascinating beasts.\n\nWhat surprises me the most is how absurd they are. Like a recent one I had, where I was eating at an elaborate buffet, dropped a smartphone from the edge of a tall building and dived into an ocean to retrieve it. Our dreams are the manifestation of the most absurd ideas that float around in our heads.\n\nBut absurdity is at the root of invention that bends our world. Hosting a stranger you met on the internet in your house or the idea of a phone with just one button were absurd ideas to start with. When Walt Disney showed movie executives his first 7 minute Mickey Mouse cartoon, they did not laugh at the cartoon. They laughed at him.\n\nDreams are absurd because the Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex that is responsible for rational thinking, is inactive when we dream. This logical part of our brain is adept at killing absurd ideas and keeping us functional.\n\nBut there's a side-effect here. If our idea starts off as a wild oak tree in a forest full of conifers, the logical brain uses a pair of shears to chops off branches that are unruly and curtails the ones that drift too far. In the end, it turns our oak-tree-shaped idea triangular just like all the conifers around.\n\nSo how can this dreamy, diffused part of our brain be effectively harnessed? Salvador Dali did this by sitting on his chair with a bunch of keys dangling from his hands. When he would fall asleep and enter a dreamy state, the keys would slip from his hand, clatter on the floor and wake him up. He would then write down whatever he saw and use it as inspiration.\n\nBut is this ritual of harnessing one's dreams limited to the realm of modern art, where absurdity is an asset? One other person used the same ritual that Dali did, but characteristically, with a few ball bearings in his hand - Thomas Edison.\n\nIt is little wonder that when someone simply exclaimed, \"I have a dream\", it caught on.\n\nInspiration: This fantastic meta-learning course that I keep bringing up on this blog."

    "body": "I read recently that data-science is replacing an MBA as a preferred qualification for careers in business. In a fast changing world, one where textbooks have lower shelf lives than a can of beans, how does one acquire knowledge that is timeless?\n\nBehind every field of human knowledge, there are bearings that do not change - the first principles. When every game in the rule changes, these axiomatic truths do not change.\n\nSo how does one get to the first principles in any discipline? By repeatedly asking the 'How to' question.\n\nWhen it comes to learning, one can start with deciding which subject to learn. Today, the answer is increasingly data-science. Yesterday, this answer was different. The subject realm is fluid. It has a low shelf-life.\n\nTo step higher, we ask a 'How to' question - How to learn a new subject? We now enter the domain of meta-learning, with concepts such as chunking, interleaving and spaced repetition. These concepts have been documented and formalized today. But they have been used by Aristortle, Chanakya and Leonardo-Da-Vinci alike. Interestingly, all of them are teachers.\n\nTo step further back, we ask another 'How to' question: how to meta-learn. The answers here are rooted in neuroscience. These concepts, which we are still documenting in the 21st century, have been applicable to the human species since its conception. They are the timeless truths about how our brains are wired. The scientist's mission is to uncover these truths.\n\nIn another realm, the cook prepares a tasty dish by following a recipe. The chef studies the raw materials - different cooking ingredients and their effect on flavouring and taste. The food-scientist studies our tongues' respond to different chemicals. Accordingly, the recipes we use today are, at most, 200 years old. We have used the same ingredients to cook for about a thousand years now. Acids have tasted sour and will taste sour for all of eternity.\n\nIn a fast-changing world, the first-principles that do not change become invaluable. So how does one get to the first principles? By asking 'How to'."

    "body": "Daniel Pink was a political speechwriter for Al Gore in his early career. While the speeches he wrote were being delivered, he had a unique vantage point. He could focus all his attention on how the audience responded to each sentence, each punchline and each factoid he had included. He would also notice portions of the speech that his boss would skip over, the words he would replace and the places he would depart from the script to speak impromptu. In this manner, he would get instant feedback on what worked and what did not. Eventually, he translated his skills in speech-writing to author several acclaimed books.\n\nHaving a live audience is a luxury. They can come in several forms - the attendees that listen to a politician, the passengers that a flight attendant greets, the colleagues you greet as you walk into the office or that distant relative who watches the same Netflix show. What they all offer in common is the opportunity to get better at making connections.\n\nInspiration: A conversation with Daniel Pink on the Tim Ferriss Show"

    "body": "Why do the greatest people in almost every field get depressed, abuse substances and often take their own lives?\n\nBut first, let us talk about video games. Every video game is a story, where progressing along the story-line gets increasingly difficult. There might be pits and bumps (like boss and bonus levels) but the difficulty level is a gentle upward curve designed for the player to keep up with. The game usually ends in two ways - it either reaches its logical conclusion (\"Congratulations Mario! You have saved the princess\") or the level of difficulty becomes too high for it to be fun anymore, and we quit playing it.\n\nVideo games exploit the inherent tendency of our mind to ratchet up expectations. This is a blessing, because as soon as we are good enough at something, our expectations go up, causing us to improve. In our professions and with things we do regularly, this happens week after week and year after year, without our conscious knowledge.\n\nThe catch here, is that our minds do not come with a level tracker. Nobody tells us that we are playing a game on level 40. Our mind's powerful tendency makes every achievement seem normal very quickly regardless of how substantial it is. In this manner, every year can be as much or more of a struggle than the previous ones.\n\nWith high performers, their minds ratchet up expectation like a mechanic on steroids. This is what motivates them to push harder, practice each day, make no compromises and become world-class. However, the ratcheting simply does not stop. It becomes an obsession. They might be an outstanding football, actor, musician or chef for the rest of the world. But they never seem to be good enough for themselves.\n\nAnd sadly, quitting the game here can sometimes lead them to take their lives."

    "body": "We live in the era of loud voices.\n\nThis is true on either side of the political, economic or social spectrum. These loud voices reach far and wide by bouncing off our Internet devices. This is true of every global policy, ranging from climate change, leaving the European Union or effective strategies against terrorism. In India, this is true of banning beef, of having a uniform civil code or the effect of Demonetization. It seems as though people everywhere are trying to outshout each other.\n\nBut why is that so?\n\nLoud, angry voices are symptoms of festering pain - physical or mental. Responding with loudness aggravates this pain, whereas silence soothes it. When an angry person is faced with silence, they cool down and start reasoning. However, silence is becoming scarcer. The loud voices seem to follow us everywhere.\n\nAnother alternative is to listen. To listen with empathy is to make enough space within one's self to understand another. When a person who is screaming feels understood, their anger does not merely cool down. It heals.\n\nAnd this healing could bring about peace at home, in the neighbourhood, in your workplace and eventually, the world."

    "body": "The job of a conductor in an orchestra is to channel synergy.\n\nAn orchestra is a complex entity. It has combinations of several varieties of each instrument type - wind, percussion and string. The conductor has a special job here. She ensures that every instrument makes a contribution its own way - the shrill trombone, the rich violin, the soothing piano and the crashing cymbal. She has to make room for the high pitched harp, as well as the low pitched double-bass. It is her job to have the furthest member of the audience listen to the tiny triangle sitting in the corner. And most importantly, this diverse collection of instruments has to harmonize to transport the audience to feel whatever the composer felt when they wrote that musical piece.\n\nIn meetings, where people gather to brainstorm, there are often conductors in attendance. These are the people who facilitate the session - give each person their space to shine and channel ideas to ensure that the sum is greater than the individual parts. These facilitators are selfless. They put the success of the team before themselves. They are empathetic listeners, with whom the team feels comfortable in opening up.\n\nHowever, there is a telling difference. Conductors are celebrated as leaders of their orchestras. At the end of the performance, they step forward and receive the audience's applause on behalf of their group. Facilitators can often go unacknowledged - especially if they are coordinating among a group of peers. Credit can often go to the people who come up with the ideas rather than the person that channels them.\n\nIn a room full of chest-beating pioneers, it is the facilitator who often ensure that the best ideas come to the foreground, while keeping themselves in the background. And this is why, they deserve our applause and our gratitude."

    "body": "When candidates walk up for an interview, Peter Thiel often asks them, \"Tell me something that's true, that almost nobody agrees with you on.\"\n\nThis question is very popular today, especially among startups. Thiel stated how the question often puts the interviewee in a spot. She is forced to express something about her world view that is unconventional. At the same time, she must be able to defend it when her interviewer challenges it. Essentially, Thiel is asking his candidate to explain ways in which she is idealistic.\n\nThe term \"idealism\" carries a negative connotation. An idealist is perceived as being impractical and rigid. Nevertheless, the idealist firmly believes in their world-view to be the truth. Entrepreneurs are idealists. They have a vision of the world that does not sense to people at large. This is why Thiel seeks them out for his ventures.\n\nThiel's question is brilliant. It breaks down idealism into its rudiments, while shedding the baggage that the term carries. It also teaches us to treat our idealism differently - to try it and test it, but most importantly, to own it rather than throw it away.\n\nFurther reading: Peter Thiel's interview with Forbes"

Today, I work as a consultant who helps his clients adopt process automation software. I often get asked (and ask myself) if my mechanical engineering degree is a waste, considering what I do now.\n\nAn essential part of  learning is a process called 'transfer', where new learning borrows common elements from fields we are already familiar with. In this manner, the brain is efficient at learning something new without starting all over again. This is also the reason why analogies are effective tools for teaching.\n\nFrom my 7 years of training in mechanical engineering, I learnt to look at systems as a medley of inputs, outputs, and their transformation. I examined how safe a system was for a given range of inputs, and how that changed with time. The methods of examining these problems are still relevant to what I do today.\n\nThe extent to which learning can be transferred is variable. One of the determinants here is our perspective - whether we embrace our past degrees as useful tools, or consider them as sunk costs. Assuming the former will have us revisit these elements and apply them to new learning. Assuming the latter will lead us to ignore them and have them gradually erased from our long-term memory.\n\nA lot depends on our intent. Over time, it turns into a self-fulfilling prophesy."

    "body": "\"Who are you?\"\n\nThe question, \"who are you?\" is abstract and difficult to answer. The easier alternative is \"what is your life's story?\" Whenever we humans encounter a difficult question, we answer it by substituting it with one that is easier to answer.\n\nOliver Sacks speaks about how our identities are continuously constructed at every moment, and fit into a narrative that we whisper to ourselves. On encountering new information, it is assimilated to fit with our existing narratives. This new information can either be independent of our narrative, be aligned with it or go contrary to it.\n\nIf this information bears no relation with our identity, we are open to correction. We update our knowledge and change our view on it. This type of information is mostly trivia, like how the Great Wall of China, can be seen from the moon. On knowing that this is false (which it is), we immediately correct our beliefs.\n\nIf certain facts are aligned with our existing narrative, we embrace them and engage with them with all our attention. We remember these facts well and store them in our armoury to strengthen our narrative. This is why we remember all the good decisions of our favourite politicians or the best moments of our favourite sportsperson, because they are integral part of our identities.\n\nWith information that contradict our narratives, the ride is not pleasant. This information can trigger automatic responses in our brain that are similar to our response to physical harm. We are programmed to avoid this situation and are likely to ignore any information that triggers it. If somebody criticizes a piece of our narrative, we ignore them, avoid them or pity them for their poor understanding of the world,\n\nThis relationship we bear with information that relates to our identities is the meta-bias. This overarching bias could dictate several other cognitive biases such as confirmation bias and the backfire effect (where our existing beliefs grow stronger in the face of contradictory information). The meta-bias leads us to be blind to our own flaws - because they contradict the narratives that form our identity. It could cause group think - taking sides with several other people reinforces our own narratives. It is responsible for the endowment effect, because owning something makes it a part of our identity, and increases its value in our eyes.\n\nThe meta-bias starts off from our earliest childhood experiences. It is vital to our self-preservation, because unless we are self-centered, an animal as smart as we are would realize the inherent pointlessness of life on a tiny blue speck floating in the vastness of space and quickly lose the motivation to stay alive. Hence, evolution has made the meta-bias an automatic process - just like our reflex actions.\n\nBut considering the world we inhabit now is different from the one in which we evolved survival mechanisms, our innate tendencies can distort our understanding. The first step in making this correction is to recognize it in our everyday lives. Or have our friends point our biases out. With all the cognitive biases we are learning about in recent times, and I am confident that we are headed in the right direction.\n\nIs my optimism also a result of one of those very biases? *Shrugs shoulder*\n\nInspiration: The Oatmeal comic on the backfire effect"
